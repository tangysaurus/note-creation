## Understanding Positionality, Reality, and Relationships: A Multidisciplinary Exploration
*This lecture covers the crucial concept of positionality in research, philosophy, and daily life. We examine how our unique backgrounds, beliefs, and values shape our perception of reality, our relationships, and even our professional practices—particularly in forensic psychology and criminology. The session unpacks foundational philosophical debates on ontology and epistemology (what is real and what can be known), examines the spectrum between objective and subjective realities, and uses real-world examples (e.g., trauma inheritance, personal relationships, moral choices) to show how our positionality directly impacts research methods, ethical stances, and interpersonal communication. Students are encouraged to reflect critically on their own positionality and how it influences their worldviews and scholarly work.*

## 🌐 Introduction to Positionality and Epistemology
> Understanding your viewpoint shapes how you define, interpret, and justify knowledge.
- **Positionality**
  - Refers to your unique position in the world, shaped by your background, beliefs, values, and experiences.
  - Influences how you create, interpret, and value knowledge—what you see as valid or invalid information.
  - Every researcher brings a personal lens to their work, which affects:
    - What questions are asked
    - Which knowledge is prioritized
    - How data is interpreted
- **Importance in Research**
  - Valid research requires clear acknowledgment and validation of your own positionality.
  - Failing to reflect on positionality can undermine research credibility across all disciplines.
- **Epistemology**
  - The philosophical study of knowledge: its nature, sources, and validity.
  - Concerns central questions such as:
    - What distinguishes justified belief from opinion?
    - How is knowledge formed and evaluated?
    - How do individual perspectives contribute to knowledge debates?
- **Ontology**
  - The philosophical study of being and existence.
  - Shapes discussions about what kinds of things exist or are possible to know about.
- **Key Takeaway:**
  - Before beginning any research, it's essential to critically examine your epistemological and ontological stance—understanding what you believe knowledge is and how your position affects your approach.
## 🧬 Nature vs. Nurture: Genetics, Trauma, and Epigenetics
> The interplay between our genes and experiences shapes who we are—and can echo across generations.
- **Nature and Nurture Debate**
  - Class discussion opens with a poll: which dictates life course more, genetics (nature) or environment (nurture)?
  - Consensus: It's not binary; both play interconnected roles.
  - Personal anecdotes:
    - A story about a man and his biological child (adopted out at birth) sharing uncanny similarities despite never meeting—highlighting the role of genetics in traits and mannerisms.
    - Examples of children separated at birth and later displaying similar rare behaviors (even criminality) as biological parents, again supporting genetic influence.

- **Susceptibility to Trauma and PTSD**
  - Question posed: At birth, do babies have the same chance of developing PTSD in life?
  - Class leans toward believing genetic differences exist at birth that predispose individuals to PTSD.
  - Key Points:
    - Some individuals may carry genes that increase vulnerability to stress and PTSD, while others have more resilient genetic makeups.
    - Even with identical environments, genetic differences impact stress responses.
    - Factors like maternal health and prenatal environment (e.g., nutrition, stress during pregnancy, gestational age) can also influence outcomes at birth.

- **Epigenetics: Trauma Passed Down Generations**
  - Not only genes, but **gene expression** can change based on experiences—a key concept in **epigenetics**.
    - Example: Traumatic events experienced by parents or grandparents can increase risks for conditions like PTSD in descendants.
    - Notably, people whose grandmothers were pregnant during traumatic events (e.g., 9/11) are statistically more likely (up to 40% more) to develop PTSD—even as grandchildren.
  - These findings are from longitudinal studies controlling for environment, suggesting biological inheritance beyond just DNA sequence.
    - Trauma-induced modifications in gene expression (such as chemical changes in stress hormones during pregnancy) can be **inherited**.
    - Such epigenetic marks affect how genes are turned on or off in offspring, influencing their stress responses and mental health.
  - The precise mechanisms are still being researched, but it is now clear that:**
    - Life experiences of ancestors (even grandparents) can have real, measurable impacts on descendants' mental health and behavior.

- **Key Terms:**
  - **Genetic inheritance:** Transmission of genes from parents to offspring.
  - **Epigenetics:** Study of heritable changes in gene expression not due to changes in DNA sequence.
  - **Generational trauma:** Psychological and physiological impact of trauma passed down across generations.
  - **PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder):** A disorder caused by exposure to traumatic events, influenced by both genetic and environmental factors.
## 🌍 Worldviews, Reality, and Professional Biases
> Our beliefs about reality shape not just our perspectives, but the very decisions we make as professionals.
- **Foundational Beliefs and Professional Practice**
  - Everyone holds unique views about the **fabric of reality**—e.g., belief in a deity, the Big Bang, science, etc.
  - These core beliefs, often unspoken, influence:
    - Approaches to research and evidence
    - Views on justice, punishment, and forgiveness
    - Interpretation of human behavior (e.g., are people inherently evil or capable of change?)
  - In forensic psychology:
    - Belief in retribution vs. rehabilitation guides whether psychologists recommend release or continued detention.
    - Personal beliefs about potential for change directly impact professional decisions.

- **Objectivity, Subjectivity, and Metaphysics**
  - No universal consensus exists about what constitutes reality (objectivity vs. subjectivity).
  - Classic metaphysical debates (e.g., William James’ turtles all the way down, the color purple mountain example):
    - Show how our imagination and belief systems extend beyond empirically provable facts.
    - Lawyers use hypothetical constructs (e.g., reasonable doubt) to challenge or defend claims.
  - **Infinite regress** in arguments and knowledge: Each idea often relies on another unproven idea beneath it.

- **Implications in Law, Academia, and Clinical Judgments:**
  - **Academics and lawyers:**
    - Sometimes win arguments by disproving the opponent, not necessarily by constructing a perfect case themselves.
    - Metaphysical questions ("how do you *know* that's a chair?") show the limits of certainty and highlight skepticism.
  - **Forensic psychologists:**
    - May disagree simply by doubting a colleague’s conclusions, without providing a clear alternative.
    - Personal foundational beliefs—such as faith in genetics vs. environment—affect diagnosis, prognosis, and recommended interventions.

- **Frameworks for Knowledge**
  - **Foundationalism:** Belief in a set of self-evident, agreed-upon basics (e.g., rain exists because we’ve all experienced it).
  - **Coherentism:** Knowledge is acceptable if it fits coherently with the rest of our experiences or beliefs (e.g., imagining a leopard in the rain).
  - These frameworks attempt to combat skepticism by grounding knowledge in either foundations or overall coherence.

- **Key Takeaways:**
  - There are always *unknowns* and *assumptions* underpinning professional judgments—whether in psychology, law, or science.
  - Recognizing one’s own **biases and worldview is critical** to ethical and effective professional practice.
  - Critical reflection on these underlying beliefs is necessary to avoid error and improve objectivity where possible.
## 🌈 Knowledge Paradigms & Aligning Positionality in Research
> Your philosophical stance shapes how you generate and interpret knowledge in research.
- **Understanding Positionality:**
  - Being clear on your own **positionality** (beliefs about knowledge and reality) is crucial for effective, critical research and professional thinking.
  - Not knowing it limits your ability to think critically and act as a competent professional.

- **Philosophical Stances/Spectrum:**
  - The class discussed the **spectrum of paradigms** regarding knowledge and reality:
    - **Naive Realism:**
      - Belief that true knowledge is only that which can be scientifically measured, falsified, and replicated (lab experiments, genetics, objective facts).
      - Reality is independent of observers; measurement is king.
    - **Relativism:**
      - Reality and knowledge are **inherently subjective**—each person's reality is valid, but different from others.
      - No single version of truth; all are context-dependent.
    - **Critical Realism:**
      - Blends objectivity and subjectivity: there are elements of reality that can be objectively measured, but subjective experience and perspectives also matter.
      - Recognizes both biological/genetic factors **and** lived experiences in shaping knowledge.
    - **Structuralism:**
      - Knowledge generation is influenced by underlying **structures**—such as social, institutional, or economic forces.
      - What gets studied and 'proven' in science is partially dictated by what society funds or values.
  - These paradigms influence which **methods** you align with in research.

- **Spectrum in Real Life: Family and Biological Examples:**
  - Personal stories illustrated how genetics, upbringing, hormones, brain chemistry, and environment/experience all interplay in shaping personality, behavior, and attraction.
    - Example: Brain tumor affecting attraction; hormone changes altering preferences; family personality parallels.
    - Shifts highlight the difficulty of attributing behavior to either "nature" or "nurture" alone.

- **Why Does This Matter?**
  - **Alignment:**
    - Your research paradigm should align with your beliefs about reality and knowledge.
    - Mismatch (e.g., a die-hard positivist studying critical race theory for subjective experience) can undermine research integrity.
  - **Bias Awareness:**
    - Recognizing your own biases helps you interpret research *and* prevents undermining your own work and critical thinking.
    - Allows for more honest, reflective, and effective research and professional practice.
  - **Critical Thinking:**
    - Understanding and critiquing research requires knowing the paradigmatic 'lens' through which it was produced.
    - You should be able to place arguments within this spectrum and evaluate them based on their premises.

- **Paradigm Alignment in Practice:**
  - Methods used should flow naturally from the assigned paradigm.
  - For instance:
    - **Positivists:** favor quantitative, objective, measurable data.
    - **Relativists/Critical Realists:** may value qualitative approaches and subjective narratives.
    - **Structuralists:** might analyze power, access, and institutional influence in knowledge creation.

- **Key Takeaway:**
  - There is no single "right" stance—but being clear on where you stand is necessary for substantive, honest inquiry.
## 🚔 Case Studies in Law Enforcement: Identity, Motivation, and Moral Complexity
> Law enforcement and military ethics are shaped as much by culture and environment as by individual traits or intentions.
**Formation of Moral Choices in Policing & Military Contexts**
- Participants debated whether *inherent personality traits* or *training/culture* predominantly shape ethical decision-making in policing and the military.
  - Three positions discussed:
    - People are **inherently good**
    - People are **inherently bad**
    - People are neither; behavior is situational and often unconscious—a blend of strategies to meet needs.
  - Consensus favored complexity and the role of unconscious or learned behaviors, influenced by upbringing and environment.

**Capacity for Harm and Atrocity**
- The group questioned if *all individuals are capable of committing serious harm* under certain circumstances, regardless of their background.

**Professional Identity and Motivation**
- Explored why people choose law enforcement or military careers:
  - *Self-selection*: Some may be comfortable with the idea of using force from the outset.
  - *Socialization/training*: Others may adapt to the possibility through culture and repeated exposure, becoming desensitized or normalized to violence.
  - Other motivations include:
    - Financial necessity (e.g., better pay, job security)
    - Educational opportunities (e.g., paying for college or medical school)
    - Honor, legacy, patriotism, or respect within communities
    - Forced or necessity-based enlistment
- Contrasted between UK/US policing structures and motivations—highlighting differing expectations and organizational models (e.g., number of agencies, jurisdictional complexity).

**Case Study: "Marine A"**
- Introduced as a foundational case for class analysis:
  - A British soldier in Afghanistan killed a wounded enemy combatant, explicitly referencing breaking the Geneva Convention.
  - Legal and ethical questions:
    - Is this an act of **murder** or a situational/moral ambiguity born of warfare?
    - The case is complex: prior service, context of duty, psychological and cultural factors all play roles in legal evaluation.

**Complexity of Assessing Intent and Ethical Behavior**
- Discussed difficulties of judging intent in professions where use of force is a possible or routine part of the job.
- Emphasized:
  - The impact of training, professional culture, and institutional context on ethical decisions
  - International comparisons (UK, US, France, Ireland) revealing how structure shapes culture and moral expectations

**Takeaway**
- Ethical conduct in law enforcement and military roles cannot be reduced to individual good or bad intentions—it emerges from a dynamic interplay of personal motivations, cultural forces, institutional design, and situational factors.
## 🌱 Personal Reflections, Boundaries, and Self-Discovery in Relationships
> Deep, honest conversations reveal how self-awareness, healing, and boundaries shape our connections.
- **Open & Vulnerable Reflection**
  - Participants engaged in candid discussions about their past and present relationships, acknowledging personal challenges, growth, and healing.
  - Recognized the importance of not entering a new relationship when feeling unstable, out of self-care and fairness to others.
  - Used academic ideas (like **agency, trauma, and attachment theory**) to illuminate real-life issues.

- **Boundaries & Self-Knowledge**
  - Emphasized establishing personal boundaries and respecting those of others as a foundation for authentic relationships.
  - Admitted the struggle of balancing between being generous/open and protecting emotional wellbeing.
  - Shared experiences in which setting clear boundaries prevented cycles of pain and drama ("triple win" principle: good for self, good for the other, good for the world).

- **Healing & Personal Growth**
  - Several participants openly discussed their healing journeys post-trauma or difficult relationships, highlighting the time needed to regain self-trust and stability.
  - Stressed the importance of prioritizing one's own mental, physical, and financial health before committing deeply to another person.
  - Reflected on past mistakes—choosing partners to "save" them, getting caught in unsustainable dynamics—and how insight has influenced current choices.

- **Identity & Authenticity**
  - Participants recognized quirks (e.g., "I know I'm weird, and it takes special people to get me") as parts of genuine selfhood, rather than flaws to hide in relationships.
  - Noted how communities (both academic and personal) shape one's self-understanding, and how sharing "nerdy" or unconventional sides can foster connection.
  - Accepted that knowledge, intelligence, and experience each bring their own strengths—and limitations—to relationships.

- **Desire for Healthy, Mutual Relationships**
  - Expressed the goal of building relationships rooted in mutual support, safety, and honest communication—not as placeholders or means to fill a void.
  - Opposed "leaning" on someone as a crutch, desiring instead to be solidly grounded before engaging in partnership.
  - Found value in up-front, transparent conversations about current capacity and future desires (e.g., monogamy, life logistics, career direction), even if outcomes remain uncertain.

- **Life in Transition**
  - Many identified as being in flux—school, travel, career, immigration, health—and acknowledged they aren't yet ready for major commitments.
     - Valued staying connected and exploring what is possible, while resisting pressure to settle prematurely or perform 'having it all together.'
  - Saw relationships not just as convenient, but as 'the inconvenience you want'—willingness to share life's ups and downs with true intentionality.

- **Takeaways**
  - **Self-discovery and boundaries are prerequisites for healthy, lasting relationships.**
  - Academic concepts like agency, trauma, and attachment can supply frameworks for understanding interpersonal dynamics and choices.
  - Vulnerability and radical honesty—about needs, limits, hopes, and fears—build trust and reveal the kind of partnership that's life-affirming for all involved.

2. **What is epistemology concerned with?**
3. **Briefly describe the difference between ontology and epistemology.**
4. **Explain one real-world example of generational trauma and how it relates to epigenetics.**
5. **Compare naive realism and critical realism as discussed in the lecture.**
6. **Why is understanding your own positionality important for critical analysis?**
7. **In the context of police or military service, what are some reasons people may join, and what ethical questions does this raise about harm?**
8. **What does the infinite regression problem illustrate in philosophical argument?**

### Answers
1. **Positionality** refers to the personal, social, and cultural factors that shape a researcher's worldview and biases. It is important because failing to recognize one’s own positionality can invalidate research or interpretation, as it frames how questions are asked and data is understood.
2. **Epistemology** concerns the nature, sources, and limits of knowledge; it asks how we know what we know, and what counts as justified belief versus opinion.
3. **Ontology** is about the nature of reality (what exists), while **epistemology** is about how we come to know that reality (how we justify and validate knowledge).
4. **Example:** The increased likelihood of PTSD in grandchildren of women pregnant during 9/11—this shows that traumatic experiences can alter gene expression, evidencing how epigenetics transmits trauma across generations.
5. **Naive realism** holds that knowledge is only what can be objectively measured and observed, while **critical realism** allows for a combination of objective facts and subjective experiences in shaping knowledge and reality.
6. Understanding your own positionality helps you recognize your biases, improves critical thinking, and strengthens your research and professional judgment.
7. People join police or military service for varied reasons: career advancement, patriotism, economic necessity, family tradition, etc. Ethically, this raises questions about whether willingness or readiness to do harm is innate or shaped by context and environment.
8. **Infinite regression** illustrates that every justification demands a further justification, creating a never-ending chain that challenges certainty and foundational claims in knowledge or argument.
