#### 🧬 Exploring Positionality, Epistemology, and Intergenerational Trauma
---
> "Positionality shapes your research—if you can't validate your own, your work is fundamentally flawed."
---
- **Positionality**: One’s unique position in the world
   - Includes **belief systems**, **values**, **knowledge**, and **knowledge formulation**
   - Shapes what knowledge is considered **valid** or **invalid**
   - Varies between individuals, affecting research interpretation

- **Importance in Research**:
   - Essential across all disciplines
   - Research is invalid without acknowledging and validating **positionality**

- **Epistemology**: 
   - Philosophical theory of knowledge
   - Concerns **justified belief** vs. **opinion**
   - Part of understanding one’s **knowledge structure**

- **Ontology**:
   - Study of the **nature of reality**
   - Includes questions like “Does something exist?”
   - Relevant to understanding how we perceive and define reality

- **Nature vs. Nurture Debate**:
   - Discussion on whether **genetics (nature)** or **environment (nurture)** shapes life outcomes more
   - Example: Identical behaviors in genetically related individuals raised apart
   - Suggests **genetic influence** on personality, interests, and behavior

- **PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder)**:
   - Caused by **traumatic events**
   - Question posed: Do all babies have equal probability of developing PTSD at birth?

- **Genetic Predisposition**:
   - Some babies may have **genes** that increase susceptibility to PTSD
   - Others may have **resilience genes**
   - Gene expression can vary even at birth

- **Gene Expression**:
   - Genes can be **turned on or off**
   - Influenced by **in utero environment**, **maternal stress**, and **nutrition**
   - Even if babies are born at the same time, gene expression may differ

- **Epigenetics**:
   - Study of how **environmental factors** affect **gene expression**
   - Not changes to DNA sequence, but how genes are **expressed**

- **Transgenerational Trauma**:
   - Experiences of parents or grandparents can affect descendants
   - Example: Grandchildren of women pregnant during 9/11 have ~40% higher PTSD risk
   - Trauma in **third trimester** linked to changes in fetal gene expression

- **Mechanism Unclear**:
   - Exact biological process not fully understood
   - Believed to involve **hormonal** and **chemical changes** during pregnancy
   - These changes affect **gene expression** in the fetus

- **Research Findings**:
   - PTSD-related genes more expressed in descendants of trauma survivors
   - Expression persists across **multiple generations**
   - Not due to upbringing or environment, but **biological inheritance**

- **Conclusion**:
   - Positionality, epistemology, and ontology are foundational to research
   - Nature and nurture both play roles, but **epigenetics** bridges them
   - Trauma can have **measurable biological effects** across generations

#### 🧠 Belief, Reality, and the Foundations of Knowledge
---
> "How you approach your literal reality will depend on how you see the world—and that changes everything, from science to justice to forgiveness."
---
- **Perception of Reality**
   - Individuals perceive reality differently.
   - Beliefs (e.g., deity vs. science) shape worldview.
   - Influences moral judgments (punishment vs. forgiveness).

- **Foundationalism vs. Coherentism**
   - **Foundationalism**: knowledge built on basic, accepted truths.
   - **Coherentism**: knowledge is valid if it fits within a consistent system.
   - Example: imagining a **leopard in the rain**.
      - Based on empirical experience of both elements.

- **Empiricism**
   - Knowledge from sensory experience.
   - Validates imagined scenarios through past experience.

- **Critiques of Knowledge**
   - Two main critiques:
      - **Meticulous**: challenges the **what** (content) of knowledge.
      - **Members**: challenges the **how** (method) of knowledge.
   - Example: Sitting on a chair.
      - Meticulous: questions what sitting is.
      - Members: questions how you know you're sitting.

- **Descartes' Philosophy**
   - **"I think, therefore I am"**.
   - Basis for self-awareness and existence.
   - Used to ground knowledge in consciousness.

#### 🧠 Exploring Positionality, Perception, and the Nature of Reality
---
> "If you don't know your own positionality, you're not a particularly good professional thinker."
---
- **Positionality**: One’s stance or perspective shaped by personal beliefs, experiences, and background.
   - Affects how individuals interpret knowledge and reality.
   - Influences research approach and critical analysis.
   - Essential for professional thinking and integrity.

- **Types of Knowledge and Reality**:
   - Some believe in **objective reality**: measurable, testable, scientific.
   - Others believe in **subjective reality**: shaped by perception and experience.
   - Debate between **genetic influence** vs. **environmental influence** on behavior and diagnosis.

- **Paradigms**: Frameworks or models of understanding.
   - Must align with research methods.
   - Example: Scientific paradigm values falsifiability and replication.

- **Case Study Example**:
   - Man developed **paedophilic urges** due to a **brain tumor**.
   - Tumor removed → urges disappeared.
   - Tumor returned years later → urges returned.
   - Suggests **biological basis** for behavior and attraction.

- **Free Will vs. Determinism**:
   - Some argue **no free will**; behavior determined by biology (e.g., hormones, brain chemistry).
   - Others believe in **partial free will**, with some capacity to change attraction or behavior.

- **Neuroscience and Attraction**:
   - **Brain regions** influence sexual attraction and personality.
   - **Hormones** and **neurochemistry** affect preferences and emotional responses.
   - **Endocrinology** plays a role in shaping relationships and attraction.

- **Learned Behavior and Environment**:
   - Early experiences (e.g., associating abuse with love) can shape attraction.
   - Environmental exposure and upbringing influence personality and preferences.

- **Genetic Similarity in Families**:
   - Family members often share **physical traits** and **personality types**.
   - Example: Children resembling and behaving like biological parents.
   - Step-relations may show less similarity in behavior and communication.

- **Developmental Changes**:
   - **Age 27**: Significant brain development milestone for biological women.
   - **Menopause**: Hormonal changes affect personality and attraction.
   - **Autoimmune diseases** and hormonal shifts can alter attraction and behavior.

- **Attraction Over Time**:
   - Attraction can change with age, experience, and hormonal cycles.
   - Fertility and menstrual cycles influence preferences.
   - Learned lessons may not override biological or chemical influences.

- **Robert Sapolsky**:
   - Evolutionary biologist.
   - Argues strongly against the existence of **free will**.
   - Believes all behavior is biologically determined.

- **Spectrum of Beliefs**:
   - From strict biological determinism to environmental constructivism.
   - Most people fall somewhere in between.
   - Important to recognize and articulate one’s position on this spectrum.

### Answers

1. Positionality refers to an individual's unique perspective shaped by their beliefs, values, experiences, and knowledge systems, which influences how they interpret and conduct research.
2. Epistemology is the study of knowledge and justified belief, while ontology is the study of the nature of reality and existence.
3. The 9/11 study showed that grandchildren of women who were pregnant during the attacks had a higher likelihood of developing PTSD, suggesting transgenerational trauma.
4. Epigenetics explains how environmental factors, such as trauma, can alter gene expression and be passed down, affecting susceptibility to conditions like PTSD.
5. The "turtles all the way down" story illustrates infinite regression and challenges assumptions about foundational truths, highlighting the complexity of proving reality.
6. Foundationalism asserts that knowledge is built on basic, self-evident truths, while coherentism holds that beliefs are justified by their coherence with other beliefs.
7. Metaphysics in forensic psychology helps question the nature of reality and truth, which is crucial when evaluating mental states, behaviors, and legal responsibility.
8. Critical realism acknowledges both objective reality and subjective experience, whereas naive realism assumes that reality is exactly as we perceive it.
9. Understanding positionality helps researchers and professionals recognize their biases and ensure integrity and alignment in their work.
10. "Marine A" was a British soldier convicted of murdering a wounded enemy combatant, raising questions about morality, legality, and psychological impact in warfare.
11. Beliefs about human nature influence decisions such as sentencing, rehabilitation potential, and interpretations of criminal behavior.
12. Motivations include patriotism, family legacy, financial incentives, education benefits, and a desire for structure or purpose.
13. The lecture shows that both genetic predispositions and environmental exposures shape personality, behavior, and mental health outcomes.
14. Research paradigms must align with methods; for example, a positivist paradigm favors quantitative methods, while interpretivism aligns with qualitative approaches.
15. Critical thinking involves analyzing arguments, identifying biases, evaluating evidence, and assessing the coherence and validity of research claims.
