#### 🧠 Rationality and the Causes of World War I
---
> "If it was so clear the war would take a long time, can we still speak of a rational decision to go to war in the first place?"
---
- **Seminar Focus**: Discussion of WWI as a **deliberate act** vs. **miscalculated tragedy**
   - Explore relevant **theories**: **bargaining theory**, **commitment problem**, **information problem**, **issue indivisibility**
   - Consider historical **intentions**, **misperceptions**, and **rationality**

- **Miscalculated Tragedy View**:
   - Popular post-war theories emphasized **misperceptions** and **miscalculations**
   - Example: Germany underestimated **modern warfare** and **enemy capabilities**
   - Belief that war would be **short and decisive**
   - German leaders blamed **France** or **Russia**, viewing conflict as **inevitable**

- **Deliberate Act View**:
   - Evidence suggests Germany had **accurate knowledge** of war's likely duration
   - Lieber’s research: Germans knew war would be **long and costly**
   - Suggests **intentional expansionism**, not just miscalculation

- **Bargaining Theory**:
   - War occurs when **negotiation fails**
   - Assumes **rational actors** prefer bargaining over costly war
   - If war was deliberate, challenges theory’s assumption of **rationality**
   - Raises question: Did states **exhaust bargaining options**?

- **Commitment Problem**:
   - States may prefer war if they believe future **power shifts** will disadvantage them
   - Example: Germany may have preferred to fight **Russia sooner** rather than later
   - Suggests war was a **strategic choice**, not a failure of information

- **Information Problem**:
   - Initial belief: states lacked info on **capabilities** and **intentions**
   - New evidence: states were **well-informed**, undermining this explanation
   - May still apply in terms of **strategic uncertainty** or **misleading signals**

- **Issue Indivisibility**:
   - Some issues (e.g., **territory**) may not be easily divided
   - Lieber: Germany sought **dominance**, possibly making compromise impossible
   - Expansionist goals may have made **bargaining infeasible**

- **Expansionist Intentions**:
   - Germany framed war as **defensive**, but had **expansionist plans**
   - Unclear if plans existed **before** or **developed during** the war
   - All major powers had some **expansionary aims**

- **Rationality Assumption**:
   - Bargaining theory assumes **utility-maximizing behavior**
   - Critique: human behavior is often **emotional**, **irrational**
   - States may act based on **power preservation**, **historical grievances**, or **strategic opportunity**

- **Historical Context**:
   - Tensions predated 1914 (e.g., **Franco-Prussian War**, **alliances**, **arms race**)
   - War may have been **inevitable** due to long-term **structural tensions**
   - Assassination of Archduke Ferdinand seen as **trigger**, not sole cause

- **Key Theoretical Tensions**:
   - If war was **intentional**, undermines **bargaining theory**
   - If war was **miscalculated**, supports **information/commitment problems**
   - Ongoing debate: were leaders **rational actors** or driven by **emotion, ideology, or misjudgment**?

- **Conclusion of Discussion**:
   - Important to assess whether states truly **wanted to bargain**
   - Consider whether war was a result of **failed diplomacy** or **strategic choice**
   - Central flaw in theory: assumes **rationality** in inherently **complex, emotional decisions**
---
#### 🧠 The Role of Individual Leaders and Rationality in State Decision-Making
---
> "States don't make decisions—people do, and those people often have conflicting goals, incentives, and limited information, which makes the idea of a single rational actor a useful fiction, not a reality."
---
- **States vs. Individuals**
   - States don't act; individuals act on behalf of states.
   - Question: Are individuals making **rational decisions**, or are they driven by other motives?

- **Role of Leaders in Pre-WWI Europe**
   - **Clark reading** discusses monarchs' relationships (British, German, Russian, Austrian).
   - Many leaders were **related** (e.g., British and German monarchs were cousins).
   - Despite familial ties, **national interests** took precedence over personal relationships.
   - German emperor known for **belligerence** and **peculiar behavior**.
   - Attempted last-minute intervention to stop war—**too late**.

- **Influence of Leaders**
   - Leaders had **limited influence**; many were **ceremonial**.
   - **German emperor**: head of army, important in gov’t, but lacked formal education.
       - Followed advice from **Chief of Staff**, **Prime Minister**, **Chancellor**.
   - **British king**: politically **irrelevant**.
   - **Russian emperor**: still an **autocrat**, more influential.

- **Bargaining Theory**
   - Theory assumes **one rational actor** per state.
   - Actor seeks to **maximize expected utility** (e.g., survival, economic gain).
   - Problem: **States are not unitary actors**.
       - Composed of **multiple agents** with **conflicting incentives**.
       - Agents may have **personal motivations** (e.g., loyalty to boss, electorate).

- **Modern Example: U.S. Tariffs**
   - Not all factions in U.S. gov’t agree on tariffs.
   - **Internal divisions** affect bargaining outcomes.
   - Tariffs used as **political strategy** and **signaling**.
       - Example: “America First” rhetoric.
       - Aimed at **domestic industry revival** and **global power signaling**.

- **Information and Bargaining**
   - Bargaining involves **information flow**.
   - Conflict often about **controlling the narrative**.
   - Example: Germany sent softened telegram to Russia to avoid escalation.
       - Despite this, **misinformation** or **lack of trust** led to war.

- **Germany’s Role in WWI**
   - Germany bears **significant blame**, but not **sole responsibility**.
   - Must consider actions of **multiple states** (5–6 major players).

- **Rationality in Bargaining**
   - Rationality can mean:
       - **Maximizing gains**.
       - **Minimizing losses**.
   - States may **forego bargaining** if they believe war is more beneficial.
       - Example: Germany believed it was **militarily superior**.

- **Realism: Two Types**
   - **Defensive Realism**:
       - States act to **ensure survival**.
       - Prefer **defensive strategies**.
       - Go to war only when **bargaining fails**.
   - **Offensive Realism**:
       - States aim to **maximize power**.
       - Expansion is **rational**.
       - Associated with **John Mearsheimer**.

#### ⚔️ Offensive vs Defensive Realism and the Rationalist Explanations for War
---
> "Perfect rationality is extremely difficult to achieve—leaders are human, organizations are fragmented, and even war can be a rational outcome when bargaining fails."
---
- **Maximization as survival strategy**  
   - Leads to **offensive vs. defensive realism** debate  
   - States may act offensively to secure survival  

- **Offensive Realism**  
   - Expansion seen as rational strategy  
   - Example: German behavior interpreted as **offensively oriented**  
   - Aligns with **Mearsheimer’s expansionist position**  

- **Defensive Realism**  
   - Focus on maintaining security, not expansion  

- **Rationalist Explanations for War**  
   - War can result from **bargaining failure**  
   - Even rational actors may end up in war  
   - War may occur:
      - From the start (preference for war)
      - After failed negotiations  

- **Information Failures**  
   - Misjudging opponent’s willingness to fight  
   - Example: British may have underestimated German resolve  
   - Russian negotiation failures also possible  

- **Limits of Rationality**  
   - Perfect rationality is rare  
   - Leaders influenced by:
      - **Emotions**
      - **Personal priorities**
      - **Organizational constraints**  
   - Governments are **multi-actor systems**  
      - Internal factions with conflicting goals  
      - Policy outcomes often reflect internal compromises  

- **Organization Theory**  
   - Explains how internal government dynamics affect decisions  
   - Policy proposals are often pre-bargained within the state  
   - Applies to war onset and nuclear weapons policy  

- **Post-WWI Peace Settlements**  
   - **Paris Peace Conference** and **Treaty of Versailles**  
   - Major empires collapsed: **German**, **Russian**, **Ottoman**  
   - Power vacuum filled by **France**, **Britain**, **US**  

- **US Role in Peace Process**  
   - Entered war late, less domestic impact  
   - Advocated for **liberal international order** (e.g., **Wilson’s 14 Points**)  
   - Less punitive toward Germany  

- **France and Britain’s Position**  
   - France:
      - Suffered most destruction (esp. NE France)
      - Demanded high **reparations** from Germany  
      - Sought to **cripple German economy** to prevent future threats  
   - Britain:
      - More moderate than France
      - Still leaned toward reparations  
      - Wanted to recover war costs  

- **Anglo-French Financial Dependency on US**  
   - Britain and France heavily indebted to US  
   - **JP Morgan** bankrolled Allies before US entered war  
   - US financial power central post-war  

- **Reparations and Economic Tensions**  
   - Allies needed German reparations to repay US loans  
   - Tension:
      - Too much reparations = strangle German economy  
      - Too little = insufficient funds for Allies  
   - Balance needed for economic recovery and debt repayment  

- **Legacy of the War**  
   - Debate over how transformational WWI was  
   - Some argue limited change; others see major shifts  
   - **League of Nations** treated Germany as sovereign post-WWI  
   - Contrast with post-WWII division of Germany  

- **Power Shift Post-WWI**  
   - US emerged as key financial power  
   - Britain’s global dominance declined but not drastically  
   - France and Britain reliant on US loans  
   - German economic recovery essential for Allied financial stability

#### 🌍 Power, Hierarchy, and the Limits of International Institutions
---
> "Institutions don't erase power—they often amplify it, legitimizing the dominance of stronger states under the guise of cooperation."
---
- **Post-1929 Economic Collapse**
   - US economy contracts during the **Great Depression**
   - Negatively impacts other major powers (France, Germany, etc.)

- **French Concerns Post-WWI**
   - Fear of German resurgence
   - Construction of **Maginot Line** as defense
   - Focus on **Alsace region** (linguistically and culturally mixed)

- **League of Nations and Hierarchy**
   - **Spanish argument**: League structured on **hierarchy**
      - **Non-white states** excluded
      - Powerful states dictated terms
   - **Cohen and Martin**: Institutions can foster cooperation
      - Optimistic about institutional effectiveness
      - Institutions help overcome **informational asymmetry** and **commitment problems**

- **Contradictions Between Theory and Practice**
   - League of Nations often **coercive**, not cooperative
   - Institutions used to **discipline weaker states**
   - **Minority treaties** reflect **hierarchical structure**
   - Institutions can **legitimize inequality**

- **Example: Åland Islands Conflict (1921)**
   - Dispute between Nordic countries
   - League intervened successfully
   - Shows potential for cooperation in limited cases

- **Institutions as Tools of Power**
   - Institutions can **entrench power imbalances**
   - **Mandate system** allowed Britain and France to expand empires
      - Mandates framed as **temporary stewardship**
      - In practice, extended **imperial control**

- **Cohen and Martin’s Ideal vs. Reality**
   - Argue institutions solve **distributional issues**
   - Reality: Institutions often **cement unequal norms**
   - Institutions reflect **pre-existing power relations**

- **Motivations for Joining Institutions**
   - **Weaker states**:
      - Seek **international exposure**
      - Desire **equal voice** in global affairs
   - **Stronger states**:
      - Expand **influence**
      - Control **norm-setting** and **institutional agendas**

- **Example: WTO**
   - **Smaller states** join for **preferential trade**
   - **Larger states** join to **shape rules**
   - Threats to leave (e.g., US, China) challenge **institutional legitimacy**

- **US and the League of Nations**
   - US **never joined** the League

   - Enabled **French and British dominance**

- **US Isolationism**
   - Influenced by **Monroe Doctrine**
   - US hesitant to become **hegemonic power**
   - Concerned about **security dilemmas** and **entangling alliances**

- **Power Dynamics in Institutions**
   - **Stronger states** shape outcomes even within institutions
   - Institutions may **amplify** external power dynamics
   - **Absolute gains** theory insufficient in explaining outcomes

- **Realist Critique (Mearsheimer)**
   - Institutions reflect **existing state relationships**
   - Institutions matter only in **non-security** areas (e.g., trade)
   - **Security cooperation** seen as ineffective

- **Seminar Conclusion**
   - Institutions can both **enable cooperation** and **reinforce dominance**
   - Tension between **idealistic goals** and **practical outcomes**
   - Future lectures will explore **US hegemony** and **institutional effectiveness** post-WWII
