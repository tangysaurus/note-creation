Unknown Speaker 0:02 Well, we're all here. So Speaker 1 0:05 first, first challenge is already, has already been passed. Unknown Speaker 0:09 Yeah, as always, just tick off your name on the list, Unknown Speaker 0:15 right? So, Speaker 1 0:20 okay, so what I did yesterday in the first seminar was that I asked everyone to briefly introduce themselves and what their major is and why they took this course. There Unknown Speaker 0:35 are only six people in the other seminar, Speaker 1 0:38 22 here, so this will take a bit longer, but I hope that's okay, just for everyone to get a sense who's here and why they've been taking this course, Unknown Speaker 0:48 and then afterwards, we'll start, Speaker 1 0:51 we'll start talking about the readings. Basically, I sent out a couple of questions yesterday. I'll everyone receive those. Those are just some types of questions that we will be talking about today. We'll talk about others, obviously, but also some of them. All right, just up here, introduce yourself while you're taking this course, etc. Hi. My name is Tanya. I'm a UCLA and I'm a political science Speaker 2 1:20 major. So I'm taking this course for major requirements. I think Unknown Speaker 1:32 this class is an interesting Speaker 3 1:41 criminal law International. Sydney. Speaker 4 1:46 I'm from Harvard, and I'm studying government there and also taking this class as a major requirement. Hi, Speaker 5 1:56 my name is Maria. I'm intimidated, but I've taken history reports. Speaker 2 2:01 And Speaker 6 2:08 political science, Speaker 1 2:19 okay, sports is other than its initial requirements, we need Unknown Speaker 2:26 an idea of how states operates each other, and that's a class I'm interested in, international Speaker 7 2:39 relations. My name is Arlo. I'm a philosophy major. Unknown Speaker 2:44 I'm sort of Speaker 7 2:47 taking this course really opposite most people. It's something Unknown Speaker 2:53 I don't have a lot of background or Speaker 7 2:57 experience in, and wanted to explore some of this territory before I wrap. Hi Speaker 8 3:04 everyone. My name is Audrey. I take a law degree back in Singapore, and I took this class because I have a national interest in history and internationalism. So my name is author. Unknown Speaker 3:17 I'm learning at UBC. I study Unknown Speaker 3:21 sustainable finance and, yeah, Speaker 6 3:24 just a lot of interest in this kind of area of history and cooperation, Speaker 2 3:38 UCLA and COVID science. Science, international Unknown Speaker 3:47 relations. I think we start using this, but it's really Speaker 2 3:51 interesting. Hi, Karina, I'm from UC Berkeley. I'm a computer science and a business major. I don't have much experience in like international like relations and all that, but I thought it was really interesting, and I wanted to learn more. Thought Speaker 6 4:06 it was very interesting. Hi, my name is yanjo. I'm from UC Davis. I like policies, and I'm going to international Unknown Speaker 4:15 and for policy, and also like streets from the Unknown Speaker 4:21 University of Hong Kong, majoring in social Speaker 4 4:25 science and never taking any political class before. So I want to learn the nature of calculus, academic perspective, science. And took this class because there's so much Speaker 9 4:45 and Hi, I'm Levi. I'm from Berkeley, majoring in neuroscience, so not getting Unknown Speaker 4:50 too much credit to this. But Unknown Speaker 4:53 I took this question because I thought Speaker 9 4:55 it would be useful for thinking about the world, contextualizing it. I Trish, Speaker 10 5:03 Hi, my name is Trish. I'm also from UC, Berkeley. I'm a psychology student clinical focus. I've had a practice in conflict resolution and relationship Unknown Speaker 5:18 skills for a long time, and Speaker 10 5:22 I kind of feel like this is my duty to learn a bit more in this specific current time, to see how I can help. I'm a Speaker 2 5:37 UCLA student, and I'm a public spheres major, but I'm just interested in learning more Unknown Speaker 5:43 about international relations. As Speaker 5 5:47 my name is Stephanie, and I also UCLA Affairs major. Hi, I'm Speaker 2 6:00 Alexandra. I go to UCR I'm a political science and law society Speaker 4 6:03 major there. And the reason I decided to discuss just Unknown Speaker 6:09 because, if you go, Hi, Unknown Speaker 6:11 my name is Cheyenne. I go to UC Speaker 2 6:13 Berkeley. I'm a history major. And I was really interested in this class because I studied the board of cargo conflict, and so that made me really interested in international conflict in general, because Speaker 1 6:29 that happened. Thank you. Well, so many people from California. Unknown Speaker 6:34 That's quite strange. Speaker 1 6:37 Everyone coming over here for the little European holiday. I it? Well, you're getting to see more of Europe than just Cambridge, which is lovely, of course, but just sort of a bit of a bit of a sleepy town just north of London. So are you guys here for you're here for the entire summer, right? So, yeah, is anyone going anywhere else? Like, I don't know, London, Europe, yeah, anything nice plant? Yeah, very good. Have you been before? It's good place, yeah, very nice city. All right. So what we're going to do today in the seminar is that we'll talk about some of the readings in a bit more detail. So could I just get show of hands who has read more than say, half of these readings? Just that I have an idea of like, Speaker 1 7:41 yeah, okay, about half. Okay, that's good. I Unknown Speaker 7:46 know it's been a lot of reading. I'm sorry Unknown Speaker 7:52 that is not really aware of that, unfortunately. Speaker 1 7:56 But you will be rewarded in the sense that you'll get a good understanding of a lot of what's going on in international politics very quickly through this course. So hopefully in a couple of weeks, you have a pretty good understanding of what's going on. So I think the first thing that we could talk about then would be just get it up. All right, so the first question is just the first question that I actually sent around by email. All right, so discuss the implication of viewing World War One as a deliberate act versus a miscalculated tragedy, right? Could everyone give me a sense of what kind of thought process and processes we need to go through and what kind of theories we might need to consult to think about this kind of question? Speaker 5 9:02 I miscalculated tragedy. I was thinking about popular theories after the war in the 20th century about how it Unknown Speaker 9:15 was calculation Unknown Speaker 9:18 of Germany's powers, and you would Speaker 5 9:22 also misperceptions on their part, and then deliver access reading about Unknown Speaker 9:30 how evidence actually reveals Speaker 3 9:35 that we're very well aware about state of modern technology and capabilities that thank you. Yeah, I completely agree. Unknown Speaker 9:50 Also in the rear reading, she's a Speaker 2 9:58 political defense agreement and how German leaders really did not believe that this would be like a quick conflict, and did, like you're saying that, I Unknown Speaker 10:12 think it was a political Speaker 2 10:15 universe like also increased army size as well. So I think that there were a lot of factors that pointed to them believing that there was not like a protracted conflict, but ultimately sought to blame France or Russia like some conflict that they believed was inevitable, rather than just like miscalculation. Yeah. Do Speaker 6 10:40 Some, yeah, I think there's definitely part of that this, like, one of the reasons, especially with like as friends, is like, if you compare how, like, all the warriors were, like, the soldiers were all like, in their countries when they arrived in the German ones, in the one, like some cases, the difference of the condition for the other for living definitely showed that before France, the score was supposed to be really fast, and so they didn't took that much time to prepare everything. Whereas, like, if you arrived in Germany, was like, very comfortable. They were preparing and preparing so they definitely had some information. So they couldn't, they cannot say that they didn't have any information. They had confirmed this idea of those calls of progression, but also the commitment problem with Russia that it was, yeah, better now than later for them to fight Russia and they didn't have like, any great thank Unknown Speaker 11:53 you. Anyone else? Unknown Speaker 11:59 So what I can just add on to that is my Speaker 1 12:03 the broader question of of, I suppose, fearing work right, and how that interacts with some of the things that Lieber especially discusses. Would anyone expand on the recent comments about, for example, the commitment problem, information problem, etc. So at the very beginning, you mentioned that Unknown Speaker 12:28 that Lieber discusses, for example, Speaker 1 12:32 the color of the offensive, etc, but actually that the Germans had a pretty good understanding that the war would take a long time, right? How does this new research that's been coming out? How does this affect our understanding of the war through the lens of the bargaining Unknown Speaker 12:56 theory, something I was thinking about may or may not be right, Speaker 7 13:01 but it seemed to push it more into the issue invisibility of being territory, in a sense that it's being presented now as more expansionist In intent, rather than a sequence of miscalculations about self defense and so forth would fall more under the earlier iterations of Unknown Speaker 13:31 information failure about Social Security. Unknown Speaker 13:36 What kind of territory would we be talking about? I Speaker 7 13:52 German territory, I would maybe need to go back to the articles, whether it's colonial territory or territory within Europe. Speaker 1 14:03 Yeah, that's okay, but this pose is quite an interesting point. So Unknown Speaker 14:09 the point is whether, Speaker 1 14:12 to which extent the theory remains applicable, if the war was intentional on the part of the Germans, right? And could anyone give me the central premise that theorem sets out for this entire theory, and why that might be a problem for for our understanding of the war? Yes, based on the Unknown Speaker 14:30 assumption that states are rational so Unknown Speaker 14:34 with the initial theory was expensive. Unknown Speaker 14:43 Business calculation. They thought that Unknown Speaker 14:56 works short, Speaker 1 14:58 yeah, yeah, that's great, exactly. So, yeah, it's, it's basically exactly this. So the problem now becomes, if it was so clear for everyone that the law and that the war would take such a long time, can we still speak of a rational decision to go to war the first place, right? And so now we need to kind of weigh that with some of the decisions that they made, and potentially whether other problems might be at stake here, right? So they didn't. So this is effectively talking about the commitment the information problem, right? Initially, we thought maybe there is an information problem on the side of at least one or various parties about capabilities how long the war will take, an understanding of, you know, just of a good understanding of how warfare at this particular moment works, to understand whether they can fight for a short or for a longer term. And as the Libra reading outlines quite well. It's been pretty widely assumed for a very long time that everyone thought they would be going into this war for two or three months, and then it would be over. And that new evidence paper came in 2007 but the new evidence shows us that this isn't really quite the case. They were actually much better informed than than we thought they were, right. So the information problem might not really apply in that way. Are there other ways in which the information problem might apply, or the commitment problem or issue indivisibility has just been mentioned as well in the lectures, there were the timelines, for example, as well, yes, please. Her issue Speaker 5 16:44 in the disability was mentioned that if the issues cut territory, and because Liam says Germany's old, what's your dominance? That would Speaker 3 17:01 entail our territory together? What Speaker 1 17:06 might be this is, this is an important point, right? So later, there was a discussion how expansion is. The Germans were in their aims, in their wares, and the Germans had initially framed the war as defensive. But then it was revealed later that they had, you know, they had that huge sort of expansionist plans for Europe. The question is whether they had already made those plans when the war started, or whether they adopted them later. That's not really quite clear. But all of the parties involved had expansionary ends to some extent, right? The problem is just that, if we think about war as a bargaining problem, then technically speaking, everyone should be willing to bargain, right? Do you because ultimately, I guess the way to distinguish between irrational and rational behavior here would be whether you go to war after you've exhausted all bar or all negotiations, or whether you just, you know, walk right in. Unknown Speaker 18:16 So my question would be, Speaker 1 18:18 from what you've read about this now, you know you've got, you've you have the lectures, you've got a couple of readings about this. Do you have a sense that any of these parties truly wanted to bargain, or that they and that they, for example, lost control of the negotiation, or that they went right in at one point, or that they were never actually interested in bargaining in the first place? Unknown Speaker 18:42 I it Speaker 6 18:45 actually comes from before, like you saw debating some theories about in that war was like inevitable. I think it was before there was, like teeth, like tensions were already there. So when the estimation of the air, it was more like just yeah, just the spark that like embayoscope, was already too late to move forward for negotiation and bargaining. So we spoke before, like when the patient started rising, and we they may have talked about, say, already was, like, also Fluke already with, like, 8070, with the fruition wars, there were kind of, like, where something started, maybe at that place, there was some place operating, but they may have not seen it. Speaker 1 19:39 So you would say, actually, the origins of the country and conflict go much further back Speaker 6 19:46 the tension between the countries that may have created the conflict. Um, does Speaker 1 19:52 anyone want to hop in on that? Any supportive views, any, any, any other positions on this? Doesn't matter. Was basically, if we think about bargaining again, the premise should be in theory, and I agree that obviously the tensions were rising. The premise in theory is that at any point a bargain can still be reached, right? So even if there are tensions, and they seem inevitable, the logic of the theory would tell us that, technically speaking, you still have some kind of way out, Speaker 10 20:32 but you're assuming that humans are rational and want to bargain. And the it's it's not assumed in that like human behavior is irrational and it's emotional and so depending on what, again, most behaviors are strategies to get needs met. So it really is just like this, figuring out what the need was to be met. So it doesn't really matter if Germany had the plans before or during. I mean, I have plans that I would like, but I'm just waiting for the opportunity to walk through the door, right? So it's, it's in this realm of like, yes, and so I'm, I'm, I think that especially power and positioning towards power. I think people and countries want to stay in as much power as they can. And I would suspect that like, kind of piggybacking is like, these things aren't just like, single events, right? It has relationships in the past, and so someone's crabby about this thing, and then, and that's how you gain loyalty from other countries to align towards your your needs. Oh, I can give you this, if you help me with this. Yeah, you know. Speaker 1 21:57 Well, that's an that's an extremely important point. So because this points basically to the central floor of the theory, right? The central floor of the theory is that we expect that everyone is always trying to maximize utility in some kind of way. And the question is whether, well, states don't do anything, right? It's always the people that make decisions, but people make decisions on behalf of their states. The question is just how, how capable they are of making rational decisions in the first place, or whether they are driven by rational Unknown Speaker 22:37 decisions. So this is a very important point, Speaker 6 22:39 yes, question that Ken started saying was about the importance of the individuals, and especially the leaders in this country, where or like, the maybe the tension or jealousy between leaders, how important do you think they are in Like Unknown Speaker 22:59 that time, some of them are still kind of family Speaker 6 23:07 that we're kind of face where, like the central leader had quite a lot of power. Do you think that just yet, individuals decision made had a lot of impact and a part of the beginning of the war. Speaker 1 23:21 That's a great question. Thanks. So one of the readings on the reading list in the supplementary readings, the Clark reading, talks about this very extensively. So he's a story, and he's historian here, actually, but, and he discusses in quite extensive detail the the relationship between all the monarchical lines of states, between those states. So the British, the German and the Russian, and to some extent, the Austrian leaders, were all related to each other. So the British and the German King and emperor, for example, were cousins. And so that there is this sort of bizarre narrative of the war that sort of these, like large Imperial families go to war against each other, what seems to have happened. And you can go into a bit more detail on this in the Clark reading itself, but he regards their specific influence as more limited. He regarded as more limited because they were more concerned about the well being of their own states, and kind of at some point started disregarding sort of monarchical collaboration, or something like that. It's quite well known. So the especially the German emperor, is quite well known for his sort of belligerence and sort of Unknown Speaker 25:01 peculiar behavior. Just call it dance. Speaker 1 25:05 He tried, in sort of some like, last minute intervention to stop everything from happening. It was too late by that, right? So that's not to say, however, that leaders don't have any kind of influence. There are always the leaders, the people underneath, who actually make the decisions. Most of these people, by then, apart from the Russian leader, are largely just ceremonial figures. The German leader. Yes, the German leader was still the head of the army. He was quite like important in the German government, but he had no formal education in government. He was ultimately following the Chief of Staff and and his Prime Minister and his Chancellor, the British king, by this point is irrelevant in terms of government decisions. And, yeah, sure, the you know, the Russian Emperor was, was a desperate right in this country that way, but Unknown Speaker 26:05 the lower level of people is probably more important. Speaker 1 26:09 And so let's step back and look again at bargaining theory. Right? Can someone give me a quick sense of who does the theory and vision is bargaining with one another. Unknown Speaker 26:24 What does spherance say about that? Unknown Speaker 26:27 What does he say anything about that? Speaker 1 26:42 Do, exactly? He mostly just refers to states, right? But he doesn't really go into detail on who that actually is. Why might that be a problem? I Speaker 7 27:14 Yes, different bargaining agents might have different incentives depending on the position structure of their government or and so forth. Unknown Speaker 27:26 Can you put a bit on this? Unknown Speaker 27:29 Well, a lot of times they might have, I Speaker 7 27:36 don't know, very personally specific incentives given like their relationship with Unknown Speaker 27:45 whoever's capable of hiring them. You got a Speaker 7 27:49 boss or an electorate, or that's the person that costs mine. But there's probably a wide range of things that could incentivize the actual bargaining agent beyond the position of the state. Speaker 1 28:05 So that's, that's a great point. So the central assumption of the theory is, of course, that there is a there is one actor who bargains for themselves, and that they are trying to maximize expected utility, right? And then it's usually done by a by, you know, by survival, so by maximizing chances for survival, or by just preventing harm or expanding sort of economic gain, right? The problem is, just as has just been mentioned, that this entire, this is just a shorthand for us to think about how actors bargain collective actors more easily, right? And collective actors are never just one person. They usually, they usually have conflicting ends, right? Can someone think about an example from today, for instance, where where something where similar dynamics seem to be going on in politics at the moment where there is where different actors want different things out of something, and as a result, the negotiation Is is compromised. What doesn't work according to rational calculations, Speaker 6 29:37 maybe for tariffs could be tariffs could be tariffs, an example with Walter wanted to maybe that in the short run, it may not be the most rational in terms of price wise for American. It may not be first rational, but yes, when he negotiate with other countries they don't want the Unknown Speaker 30:07 same thing, I will pronounce. Speaker 1 30:12 So if you look at the US government that's imposing tariffs on other states, right? Is everyone in the US government convinced that they should be imposing tariffs on others? No, no. So what's, what's the sort of who are the factions that are debating there on what's the economic policy of the United States should be? Speaker 10 30:41 Well, that's a, in my opinion, that's a political strategy to Unknown Speaker 30:48 sort of Speaker 10 30:52 assert one's, we'll say, dominance, or to, like, give a an air of of, I can do this to the entire world. So it's a it's a power play. In that sense, many and some of those things are also like removing ourselves from trade agreements and things like that. Just Unknown Speaker 31:17 in my opinion, Speaker 10 31:21 the thing about the bargaining is that it's about information, and the flow of information, right? And conflict isn't often around controlling the narrative, is what I call it. And so it's sort of like giving you enough information to get you either on my side, or to create that friction. And so in the sense is like Unknown Speaker 31:46 the current Unknown Speaker 31:48 US administration is Speaker 10 31:51 trying to create, not only a sense of nationalism in the, you know, America first, but make America great. And all of these like tag lines that is like, if we create tariffs, then we will create industry again. And then in the rest of the world, it's, it's just playing like, Oh, hey, I can mess with, like, the global money system if I just flick my wrist like this. And so I think it's mostly like that. Signaling is even like the Unknown Speaker 32:32 Germans were well Speaker 2 32:42 informed like they still, you know, sent, like Russia that telegram where they soften their position a lot, so that Unknown Speaker 32:50 Russia would soften that position, yeah, so Unknown Speaker 32:53 that Russia wouldn't capitulate, and that they think Speaker 2 32:59 that bargaining theory, there offers an interesting like reason for why the bull occurred, because despite there being more information on the German side, the Russians still have not a lot of information about the action. Speaker 1 33:18 So would you say, then that we might also focused too much on Germany's role in understanding whether the water rational or irrational, and ultimately, we're talking about what five, six relevant players. And it seems pretty clear from liebers account and from what I've also said in the lectures, that the Germans take a share of the blame, right, but taking a large share of the blame doesn't necessarily require us to only look at them to understand what is taking place. Does anyone want to jump in on that? Yes question. I know functionality means Unknown Speaker 33:53 acting in a way to Unknown Speaker 33:56 maximize facility. Does that mean maximizing gains of Unknown Speaker 34:03 a state or minimizing losses for the Unknown Speaker 34:07 state? Because why haven't Speaker 5 34:08 given wise bargaining the mark and rationality. States could forego bargaining for very delicate reasons because they feel like the bargain would be beneficial to them, Unknown Speaker 34:20 and they want to forego bargaining, Speaker 5 34:26 and the Germans had and they're thinking, we're pretty capable right now, Unknown Speaker 34:31 probably more capable than other states. Unknown Speaker 34:38 The result of the bargaining, no more, Unknown Speaker 34:42 but we, I think, and that would be rational, because that would be conscious, Speaker 1 34:53 yeah, I mean, so that's a very important point, right? There are different understandings of what rational decision making actually means for someone else. So later on, and I think Lieber mentions this very briefly, there are basically two different theories of realism, right? He speaks about offensive and defensive realism. This will come up later in a different lecture, given that we are already talking about so many theories that is not over complicated and bringing other two in them, but basically realism, which is the theory within theory is working, has two different understandings of what is rational behavior. Defensive really means that actors are acting on the basis that they want to ensure their own survival, right? And that this is the most rational behavior. That would mean that if you're faced with conflict, you're usually much more conciliatory, right, and you're adopting mostly defense positions, and that you only go to war when various other bargains. Fair Wright Lieber talks about this extensively offensive realism, however, which is, for example, what John mersham is known for, whose writing we discuss in a couple of weeks, maybe in two weeks. Unknown Speaker 36:19 His argument is that states, Speaker 1 36:23 rational state is actually expansion rather than defense. This argument is that power maximization rather than survival. So basically, that's how our maximization is the best strategy to survival. And that means that as a result of that, we would look at much more offensively orientated actors, right? So that's these two. That's basically the offensive versus defensive realist debate within this particular theory, and it's already also playing out in this kind of context, right? In a way, this works in the background. Here are the Germans defensively or offensively orientated, to what extent do they actually negotiate, or do they just want to expand? Because that's the best way in which they see fit to to achieve their goals, right? Unknown Speaker 37:15 And to become brief feedback back to your point. Unknown Speaker 37:19 A very important point here is that that bargaining Speaker 1 37:28 can break down and it can still be rational behavior, right? So that is also the central premise of the theory, in a way, right? It's called the rationalist explanations for war, because you have, you have no other way out anymore, and then you'll have to fight. The question is, when that? When that is taking place, right? Is it taking place from the very beginning because you think you need to go to war, or is it after a long bargain, and there isn't really any other way of going ahead? So this is a very important distinction, and Unknown Speaker 38:03 in what I've just said, would you then say Speaker 1 38:07 that the behavior of the Germans here is more, I mean, it's more offensively orientated, right? Probably quite clearly, so it would more fit Unknown Speaker 38:18 the sort of mersheimer expansionist position. Speaker 1 38:22 It that is the case, then does that mean that? Yeah, does it mean that there was really a chance for peace in the first place? Speaker 1 38:37 And to just briefly open up the other discussion. It was just mentioned before that. Unknown Speaker 38:44 Okay, so it Speaker 1 38:47 was just briefly mentioned before that it's important to look at all the actors, right? And even if the Germans, even if the Germans are rationally deciding to go to war, maybe or maybe not, that doesn't mean that other actors can't have some kind of argument failure, right? It could still have been the case that, for example, the British underestimated how much the Germans were willing to go to war, right? That's also an option, or it's possible that, as has just been mentioned, the Russians had some kind of negotiation failure, right? So sometimes information failure. So there are a lot of other kind of, other kind of conditions here that affect how we need to think about this problem to just make before we move on to some of the material from the other lecture. One important that we've brought up a couple of times is now that that Russia a so acting according to rationality requirements is very difficult, right? I'm not accusing anyone of being a rational but as you all know, acting rationally at all times is actually very difficult, right? Just if you think about your own behavior sometimes, I'm sure we've all had, you know, experiences in our own life where we probably could have behaved better or differently in more appropriate ways, right? And the same is beginning for leaders who run these states, right? They have huge government apparatuses with hundreds of 1000s of people in them, and they still have their own emotional dispositions that affect how they go into negotiations. They might prioritize some things that are actually not that important, even if they've been given all the information, right? So there are a lot of problems that come around with thinking about the onset of war if we exclusively focus on perfect rationality. Perfect rationality is extremely difficult to achieve because of who we are as people, and then also because governments are monetary actors, right? As we've just discussed in the tariff example, Donald Trump might really like tariffs, but Marco Rubio might not, right. So to actually get the parrot the tariffs passed and have them become, officially of US government policy. What usually happens is that there are factions within an administration that want different things and to the outcome of that. You know, sometimes, sometimes one faction, very clearly more powerful than the other, gets that way. But usual, what's actually already presented to another, to another bargainer is already the outcome of some kind of bargain in the first place, right? And they actually don't want, neither of them might not want what is actually put out there because they want something more extreme or something weaker, right? So there's already, there are basically, there already problems within an organization itself, right? And that's that might, that is an important condition to consider when we think about the onset of war and or any kind of organization, how they work, right? So this is a very important takeaway. All right, and we will come back to this several times. This is this specifically called organization theory, which talks about this in more detail in the nuclear weapons reading Unknown Speaker 42:38 how we can move on a little bit to, Unknown Speaker 42:43 I guess, the aftermath of the war. So, Speaker 1 42:48 yes, several of these things talk about the legacy of the war, right? Could someone give me a sense of what their views are, of how transformational was this war? Was this war a big change, or actually not as much as we think? And what are the reasons for that? I think Unknown Speaker 43:10 that the war itself, Speaker 2 43:13 I'm not sure the tools reading really said that the outcome of the war was very different, in that the League of Nations took it for granted, almost that Germany was a sovereign state, whereas in the past, Speaker 2 43:35 you have the World War Two, you know, they went back to sort of divided Germany, because the idea of unified Germany, as you know, conducive to Unknown Speaker 43:51 peace, wasn't really a like idea that was popular. Speaker 6 43:59 Does anyone want to respond on that all those like the year by a Unknown Speaker 44:04 lot of companies Unknown Speaker 44:08 In Europe, pretty late. Unknown Speaker 44:13 Was just like the day. Yeah, any questions about this Speaker 6 44:29 preview, what they wanted, what they thought at this time, the best, another word, and they may have not had like enough. Here's enough time to really find which, which format was the best. Speaker 1 44:52 Yeah, can anyone expand on that a little bit? So they have, you know, they have the Paris Peace Conference right after the war, and they have the Treaty of Versailles. And there were, I think, two other three keys that kind of, you know, reorder the international system after this war, right? I mean, the Russian Empire is kind of gone. The German Empire is in. The Ottomans are gone and gone, right? So there is a big power vacuum, France, Britain and the US are the key winners of the war in the end, right? I mean, the war for a long time, the war was basically stalemate, and at the very end, the Allies win quite a second, right? And what are the relationship between the Allies here, and how might that affect what happens in the years to come after the tooth reading especially talks about this quite extensively. Does anyone want to comment on that Speaker 4 46:02 at the end, because the US came into Lake, their member of cow, which was much lower in Britain and France, often because it wasn't a Homeland War for us, for the US. And so because of that, and because they really weren't there for negotiations, for the treaty, it allowed Britain and France to really, I guess, not act rationally, take out what vengeance they have on Germany. The US wasn't heavily involved. They led to a tree that ultimately didn't work. Speaker 1 46:39 Can you explain? So usually, I guess, the different visions of France, Britain and the US, what? What were those positions? Well, I would say, Speaker 4 46:52 for Britain, they wanted to get as much as they could out of Germany to kind of recruit for whatever damages they had during the war. And they wanted the complete blame to be on Germany in the US. I don't even have that much of a priority. They wanted just International Peace in order, especially with Wilson in the 14 Points, he just wanted to create a new kind of liberal, I guess, international system. But that was not a priority. Experienced the heaviness of the war directly. Speaker 1 47:28 Yeah, exactly. So, I mean, most of the war on the western was fought on French territory, so Northeastern France is basically destroyed, and which is, and I briefly mentioned this in the lecture and displays on the tooth reading, which is the reasons why the French are so interested in having so much reparations, right? The tooth reading talks extensively about the different the different priorities that the states having the kind of reparations that they want from Germany especially, and the French notably, want much more, for example, than the amount of cities, right? Britain is a bit more moderate, but more on the French than on the US side in terms of preparation. What is an additional factor that shapes the Anglo French position to get so much money out of the Germans. What? Why? Apart from just reconstruction, what's their relationship to the United States? Unknown Speaker 48:39 Even? Year, the Speaker 6 48:43 US know everything, like everyone in Unknown Speaker 48:48 Europe, there's a more and the Speaker 6 48:54 power is not decentralized in Unknown Speaker 48:59 Europe as the world Speaker 6 49:02 countries, so there's that sense they want to make sure that they still have this kind of like our friends. So try to get as much as from Germany to still be one of the main forces, like Fran manship that, Speaker 2 49:22 like brand name, was to protect their country against invasion and general menace of German power, of course. And I think that they were anticipating, you know, like, the potential that Germany could have to, like, you know, perhaps another conflict because of, like, long history of, you know, conflict between the two countries. And I think that you've also mentioned that, you know, all of the destruction that has happened in, you know, like the north part of France was meant to cripple their economy permanently. So, like you were saying, I think that it was really an attempt Speaker 4 49:59 to the power mentioned that power balance shift from Europe happened because the US was basically getting out all of the loans to fund the war towards the end, and so they wanted so many reparations so that they would be in debt to the US. Unknown Speaker 50:16 Yeah, exactly. So Speaker 1 50:19 most of the, I guess the French architecture of the interval period is shaped by that dynamic, right? It's shaped by Britain, which used to be, financially speaking, the most powerful state in the world, until about 1917 or so, where Britain, which has been bankrolling France, then can't really do it anymore. And the Americans stepping off. JP Morgan steps in, basically the bank itself giving out huge amounts of loans to Britain and France. And then at some point, the Americans see themselves forced to basically intervene in the war. So before the US actually formally enters the war. JP, Morgan has been bankrolling the allies for years. Duce doesn't talk about this chapter that much, but he talks about it at once in the reading. But what's interesting here, then is that there is this kind of dependency relationship between all these actors that is basically hinging on US financial power after the war, right? Britain and France. Britain is still, territorially speaking, the largest power in the world, and it is recovering through the interwar period. So as you've been reading in some of these readings, maybe British decline. Sure, there is British decline in the interwar periods, but it is not as pronounced as used to be the orthodoxy Britain and France. Britain, yeah, Britain and France are heavily indebted to the US. The only way they can get that money is through Germany, which means that there has some kind of interest in the German economy recovering, right? So they can't impose too much, but they can't also impose too little. So there is a certain kind of tension there. If they just impose too much preparation, they will just strangle the German economy, which kind of was a little bit in the 1920s so for some time, this actually does work. And then in the second half of the 1920s and especially after 1929 this doesn't really work anywhere, because then the US economy itself really contracts. And actually the US economy experiencing the Great Depression, then really badly affect these other three states, and then we get into the 1930s but Speaker 6 52:51 I don't know I said this, but something else was like, go very true that year, but France kind of like worrying about what German would do after The war, and then come back at some point and see that with, like the National line, which was very big to human side, starting the projects, they already knew that they were already expected, and probably also Because of all the region of Alsace, which is using French and German and French, Unknown Speaker 53:25 and they were probably Unknown Speaker 53:28 Germany to respond to that. And, Unknown Speaker 53:33 yeah, yeah, Unknown Speaker 53:35 yeah, that makes sense. Exactly what happened, right? Unknown Speaker 53:39 Let's talk about Speaker 1 53:43 Cohen and Martin's work about cooperation and how, I guess, how does the, how does, what learn about the League of Nations, for example, in this final reading, how does that interact with Cohen and Martin's understanding of international cooperation and international organizations? Would you say that the Spanish account contradicts those kind of theories. What's your kind of viewpoint? Speaker 1 54:34 Let's maybe first do a quick summary of what span actually obvious. So what is Spanish argument about the League of Nations hierarchy Unknown Speaker 54:52 attempting to Unknown Speaker 55:02 eliminate she? Not white states were excluded by even Speaker 3 55:12 though there was a hierarchy where the older seats, more mature and more powerful states dictated that Speaker 5 55:20 requirements under which students view as international system, and then Cohen, Speaker 3 55:32 it's like the debate of, do institutions really do matter on the Unknown Speaker 55:39 international level? And their conclusion Speaker 1 55:51 is, sometimes, yeah, but generally speaking, they're quite optimistic, right? They have a pretty positive outlook about how institutions might work. Speaker 6 56:01 Also because, like, the problem was more sorry in the League of Nations, and it was like the like, first mandate drug version. It was probably not already good enough. Some they were like, if not on and there's a few poem with like I was saying, there were like, few like ideas of like, self definition of nation that was not evenly represented, but we've seen still some good examples where they were like, kind of like on as they consider like equal like countries without the hierarchy, a unit, islands within Finland or Unknown Speaker 56:43 conflict about there around 1921 Speaker 6 56:48 I don't know, actually, yeah, maybe there was, he was a conflict on islands between two Nordic countries, and there was being, like, some islands, kind of middle and I think in that sense, where the League of Nations like intervene and gave up information to most people like him, Armenian, and definitely helping the situation that we see that as soon as there's a kind of you're working between the countries That didn't work as well as, I think the town, I Speaker 2 57:22 think that human and Martin sort of view that institutions become goals by which rational states will achieve mutual gains and civility. And this is done because institutions help them by overcoming informational asymmetry and commitment problems. I think that this point is very contradictory to that, because, as I mentioned, Solomon really showed how it became like this institution sort of became a disciplining power for the other powers of the world that weren't the wins of the war, and it was, I think she said, they said premise on hierarchy and inequality, like such as a minority treaties. So I think that that's, I agree Colin would want to talk Unknown Speaker 58:19 about distributional issues. Yes, guess, Unknown Speaker 58:28 that her point is institutions can Unknown Speaker 58:35 actually enshrine those industry Unknown Speaker 58:43 those more power Unknown Speaker 58:52 recognition Speaker 1 59:00 states, certainly, yeah, that's so what we have here is basically the ideal theory of how institutions should work, and an example of where this clearly was not the place, right? I mean, this final reading level quite well, and this is a very important point here that pre existing correlations also exert themselves again within those institutions, right? And that affects how institutions work. And regardless of you know, the idealistic premises upon which they have been built will still affect the relationships between the states within them, right? So, and we'll see this next lecture when we talk about the system that the United States set up after the war, which does after the next war, which does work much better than this one here, Unknown Speaker 59:58 but there is clearly Unknown Speaker 1:00:01 an idle Trish. Iron Speaker 1 1:00:04 dominance institution that manifests itself in in various ways, right? There is this dominance of mostly south eastern and Eastern European states that effectively beholden to Iran dominance as a result of this, right? And then there is and the readings that I have enlisted for today, they don't really discuss this as much because I can only actually assign so many readings. But I've shown some maps about this. How, basically the leak, the leak make those Britain and France to expand the Imperial territory as well, right? And they do it through this whole of mandates. Right? Google mandates so that a mandate implies some kind of temporary stewardship, right? Why is the league enabling an angle of French power. Why is that? What does this? What does that tell us about the relationship between states and Unknown Speaker 1:01:11 institutions? Unknown Speaker 1:01:15 Because go ahead and Martin, they say Speaker 1 1:01:19 that everyone can collaborate in them, right that there is scope for cooperation. But this just seems that these relative gains concerns of these states translate themselves into them, right aspect of institutions Speaker 2 1:01:31 which have a legitimizing power for powerful Speaker 2 1:01:42 states. Powerful states that are weakened them so France, over and without support of the leaving nations were to issue a document saying, I want the surgery, Unknown Speaker 1:01:58 because they're operating through the leading nation that has Speaker 2 1:02:02 religions. Legal nations that has legitimizing, perhaps even lawful sort of opposite, something that rational states have, like they're very identical, that they choose to cooperate. I think that believe in nations was very Of course, coercive. These states wanted to be seen as legitimate and sovereign. Also had the power to create norms about how to be like a sovereign state worthy of indeed civilized. That's great. Thank you. Does anyone else want to call on us? Speaker 1 1:02:47 Yeah. So to expand on this a little bit, so as we can see, and as we were discussing subsequent readings as well, institutions, so as and Martin's work a bit more here institutions, as they argue, they mostly are there to solve distributional issues, right? That's their argument. But as we already see here, that's not really the case, right? They create, they create and legitimize particular norms, right? They They cement already unequal relationships even further. Sometimes these are all things that, according to absolute gains concerns, shouldn't really be occurring. And so a central problem that Corinne and Martin don't really look at is the relationships of states outside of these institutions and the well, I guess the reasons why they enter these institutions in the first place, right? And what are the reasons why weaker states enter institutions? And what are the reasons why stronger states enter institutions? Can anyone comment on that? Unknown Speaker 1:03:59 So what's Yeah, I would Unknown Speaker 1:04:01 say that smaller states want to get Unknown Speaker 1:04:05 international exposure, be able Speaker 6 1:04:09 to talk to other countries as one person, just like another cookie, even though they're smaller. Whereas I would say the more powerful state want to, Unknown Speaker 1:04:19 kind of, like, expand their Speaker 6 1:04:22 bridges. Also their influence, in more general sense, where they want to make sure that that they are the ones, kind of like, even though there are some Joshua cooperation, kind of like, controlling these ideas, and maybe the fact that there's the fact that, Speaker 4 1:04:47 like a more recent example, with the WTO, like member states get preferential treatment when it comes to trade and care percentages and things like that, and so smaller states when it comes to organizations like that to get that preferential trade, and then, like mentioned before, bigger states join, so that if they still have some kind of control in the system. But like my question recently with the WTO, like the US has threatened to leave, and China has also threatened to leave. But it's like, what happens when, like, larger member states don't become a part of an institution, and how does that affect the legitimacy of the institution itself? Because it's kind of like something that we have to buy into for it to work. Speaker 1 1:05:35 Yeah, yeah. Well, that's a great question, because it's actually the case here, like the US never entered the League of Nations. Unknown Speaker 1:05:43 So, Speaker 1 1:05:46 yeah, what do you guys think? I mean, you've seen the statistics about sort of inter allied relationships, you've done the readings. What is your sense of how the absence of the United States affected the league in itself, especially given, you know, the 14 Points, and let's say, possibly they were being Unknown Speaker 1:06:13 implemented Unknown Speaker 1:06:18 with the 14 Points and then the US not joining Unknown Speaker 1:06:29 French and British dominance probably Unknown Speaker 1:06:35 changed that a little Speaker 6 1:06:39 bit, not stocks, yeah, they were as like French and British had the same goals exactly, and so they were happy With the main system. Anyone else? Unknown Speaker 1:06:56 Any comments? Yeah, wonderful. Talking about how Unknown Speaker 1:07:03 institutions kind of treat the higher institution, Unknown Speaker 1:07:07 international institution, Speaker 3 1:07:12 global power, and have the two most common nations in the league Unknown Speaker 1:07:17 indebted to the state that you need to join the League. Speaker 5 1:07:21 It's just, it just gives the league less legitimacy, and then one of the meetings, Speaker 4 1:07:29 how, yes, the US would have all this power and status all of a sudden. So it's very important to Unknown Speaker 1:07:36 know what was happening in us, but Speaker 3 1:07:39 because they were part of the state, just no one knew what was happening, the US, then that possibility, Unknown Speaker 1:07:44 yeah, I think that, Speaker 2 1:07:53 like the US decision to not join the League, which is particularly interesting, I think the tectonic reading briefly mentioned, like the Monroe Doctrine, which, you know, I feel like really illuminates sort of this trend in US domestic politics at the time, even before the war, Wilson was very didn't want to identify the US as the war, and just wanted To protect interest. And there's only one with any of there's only one those interests were like violated, and the Zimmerman Telegram of Mexico, which violated hemispheric power that the US eventually could involve themselves. So I think it was a return sort of that trend, of that sort of kind of spirit divide. And I think that the US really, like you were saying, it was not really ready to be this hegemonic power that was like the world. I think that, I think that there were likely considerations of future security dilemmas and alliances that could have formed the us into war, something that really played into their decision not to join. Yeah, Speaker 8 1:09:10 thanks, individual, that there'll be some kind of power play in these kind of international organizations, because, like, on the one hand, we're talking right now that we want. Like, how Unknown Speaker 1:09:24 do states, like the Speaker 8 1:09:26 US to be involved on the other hand, smaller states? Speaker 1 1:09:33 Yeah, I mean, it is inevitable that effectively, the interests of the stronger and and of weaker states that they are contradictory in some way, right? And especially in the readings for the next lecture, for the US lecture on us hegemony after World War Two, then the icon very reading talks about this very extensively, right? There is always, there is this kind of tension. And the understanding is that, in theory, that's what everyone wants, right? What happens in practice is that, of course, more powerful states, due to their material imminence outside of the institutions, can very heavily sort of skirt negotiations in their favor, right? And so they end up getting higher gains, usually even within the institution. So the entire absolute gains discussion, which we will return to in the future, this might only for some areas, for example, and less so for others, right? So, for instance, the Cohen and Martin reading, it responds to a critique by Mearsheimer, right? As you see this, we will be doing this reading for a subsequent lecture, just very long, and it doesn't really comment on the themes of this lecture, very much. So I signed it for a different one, but we will be coming to that. But they respond directly to the claim of mersheimer that institutions only matter for non security relationships, right? So there is this claim by realists like mersheimer who say that. Well, he says several things. One of the things is, then he said, is that the relationships within institutions are just in the relationships that states already have outside those institutions. Anyway, institutions actually don't matter, right? As we've seen it today, they actually do matter in the sense that they're potentially even amplified the power of powerful states, right? But he also says specifically that maybe the institution is have a point when it comes to trade, but they certainly have no idea what they're talking about when they're talking about security, right? How true that is. We will see in the future. We will talk about this again in subsequent lectures and seminars. This is a good point to end the seminar on. I will be releasing the Unknown Speaker 1:12:12 essay questions, I think, Unknown Speaker 1:12:17 to your emails, and Unknown Speaker 1:12:20 otherwise, I'll see you next week for the next lecture and.
