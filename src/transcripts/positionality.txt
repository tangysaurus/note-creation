Speaker 1 0:00 Faculty, applied positionality, anything like that in terms of research paradigm, approach. Okay. So first thing to say about this is that regardless of the subject you are interested in or that you predominantly major in, and the only thing I would say is this is more of a listening kind of thing. So don't worry about not having these slides. There's more options. But basically, the important thing to note is that regardless of the subject you're in, positionality is super, super, super important. If you do not know and you are not able to validate your positionality your research is, in fact, that's straight up, and that's for every single subject that you're in. So essentially, what is positionality? Speaker 1 0:57 So when we're looking at positionality, it is essentially divided up into a few separate areas. But positionality in general, can be described as your unique position in the world, your belief system, your values, your knowledge, how you formulate knowledge, what knowledge you value, which knowledge you don't all according to you uniquely as an individual, that will differ across the board. And if, for example, you see knowledge or knowledge formulation or types of knowledge as valid compared to the invalid, and then you compare that to like the person next to you, and they fundamentally don't think that knowledge is the same thing, then you're starting at different ends of analysis, and you'll immediately evaluate each other without stating the obvious, right? So positionality basically forms in one of this, this logic, and essentially all this is, is the philosophical theory of knowledge. Is the etymology, if you're interested, and it grapples with justified belief and opinion. So this is essentially what part of your knowledge structure is opinion based what part of your knowledge is justified belief, and where do you sit with it? This is what it says in a minute, and then you have ontology. So anyone who's like, deeply into philosophy will know about, like ontological arguments, and basically does not exist. That's like part of this, but it grapples with the very nature of reality, and that's what this seminar is going to be about. Because, as you remember in the last lecture we did, just by show of hands. Who thinks that nature, your genetics, your biology, the stuff you are born with, dictates your life course, more than nurture, more than the environment. Hands up, if anyone thinks that is true, but biology will dictate more about your life than anything, but social, environmental. I'm not surprised. Unknown Speaker 3:10 It's not, it's not a binary yes or no. It's just Speaker 2 3:13 it's not binary. But I have like personal reasons, Speaker 3 3:19 yes, yes, and I used to believe the other thing because, and what changed my mind is that my Can I share my my stepfather never had children, And 40 years go by. 23andme fine. He they someone finds him. Not only did he look alike, but they've lived similar past. The person who birthed this child gave it up for adoption, so it was like no connection to anything, and he had his similar laugh, similar interests in like guitar playing, guitar riding, motorcycles, music and doing the things that he did. And it was, it was then, I mean, like mannerisms to the words he used and spoke, and like how he thought about things. I was just like, whoa. I don't know now, had this whole other belief it Speaker 1 4:22 was amazing. Semi recently been quite a few instances where people have been separated at birth, and for example, someone may have been filed by someone who subsequently has been found guilty of murder. And on like five separate occasions, it turns out that, like the child they gave up at birth, has also murdered people no connection to each other in a whole life, course. But like it happens, who also thinks that, for example, I'm going to use this PTSD. Are we all familiar with PTSD? Excellent? Not Excellent. But that happens. So who can tell you what PTSD essentially is, where does it come from, traumatic events, right? So you think that when you are born, you're on an equal playing field, right? So some of you think, no, but you're all the same. People that said that nurture is more important than nature. So why would you think you're not on an equal playing field? And I don't mean because you are born into that family. Don't predict ahead at the point of birth, there's been none of you haven't even met your parents yet. At the point of birth, you as this thing, zero minutes old, and another child next to you. Do? You have an equal chance, based on nothing else, of developing a PTSD at that point. Doesn't matter who your parents are. Doesn't matter. You know, you can be exposed to if we just took you and said, here's one baby and here's another baby, and if we switch them up and have two different environments, what happens? Who thinks that at that point, just the baby. Don't think about parents and think about the environment. We just did that baby in a moment, and when we did some tests with them, they would have the same chance of developing PTSD as the baby born right next to them. Who thinks, yes, they, in theory, should have the same chance or probability of birthing PTSD. Nothing else considered. So you all think there's going to be a difference. Why? If you all think pretty confidently, you're still in the room, that there's a difference, what's the difference? Why Speaker 4 6:35 those genes that like affect how you're going to handle stressful events, and so it doesn't necessarily mean that, like, like, I still think maybe the environment is more important, because we probably know, like, obviously, no, it's perfect. But like, calm, perfect life. Like, it still means the environment isn't a triglycer. But if both those babies were then like a stressful event, like, more as a classic example, one of them could have genes that make like, stress turn into like, a longer lasting effect, where the other longer lasting effect, where the other one would be more resilient against it. Unknown Speaker 7:13 Sure anyone did for me want to add to that, Speaker 1 7:19 but GD 19 is true, not like any other method. Like, do you think that there are physical conditions change, whether Unknown Speaker 7:38 or not so not, we're not Speaker 1 7:40 really, we're not getting probability that they may or may not encounter something later. We're just looking at that baby. Why better than them? So nothing later, just there and then. I think it also has to do with, like, obviously your genes, as mentioned, but being turned on and off. So I think another thing is, okay, maybe experiment, yeah, so maybe you know, but it might turn on from one of the babies and not the other. So, yeah, do you think we can measure that equipment? So not what might happen, not in the penis question might change what she does that point, that Unknown Speaker 8:20 point, they spray tap. Speaker 3 8:29 I think that there's just too many variables to actually cover based on nutrition of the mother and her levels of stress, because that's also been measured and researched and as as theoretically, right, and then how long they were they were carried as well, also impacts, because if they just, just because they were Born here and at the same time doesn't mean like, one has had more time in utero, and the other time is like, maybe, you know, a trimester early or something like that, and so that just the child with less time is always going to have. So these Speaker 1 9:15 babies are both born and nine months to the day that's taken out of it. So they're born at the same time, silly tailoring, and you consider nothing else. So we're just down to this. What is there the gene expression at the time they are born? Right? Does anyone think that what your parents experienced, not their genetics, what your parents experienced in life, so not subsequent. We're not talking Yeah, because my mom was trauma. So when I was growing up, I said, none of that. We haven't met mum yet. But just because Mum experienced a traumatic event when she was 16, she's now having this baby at 36 not even met that baby yet. What mum experienced at 16 Does that have an effect on how likely this baby is around, how to develop? PTSD, no other conditions, no other variables. So you can't be sitting there thinking, yeah, there's no one's exposed. Like, maybe mum isn't the pass on that trauma. Like, vicariously, we've not met mum. The baby's individual. So if that baby gets lifted up and brings an adopted them, do they have less of a chance of going to be to see because they're not with that mum who experienced trauma 16, who thinks that they're so some of you are saying no. So who thinks if you take that baby mum had trauma, 16 did not have trauma early on the time took that baby, thought about that baby, and then that baby was given to someone else. Does that change their role to know them in PTSD Speaker 5 10:49 at that moment? I think yes, for what reason? I think that your genes can develop or Speaker 1 10:54 change. They can later on. But what about child babies? What? What do you mean later on. So like, not the throughout the baby's life, or do you mean the mom's Speaker 5 11:04 No, no, I'm saying the mother's genes changed, and therefore they passed on to her child. So Speaker 1 11:09 essentially, yes, there's a massive difference, and we've only just noticed. The reason we only just know this is because of Unknown Speaker 11:19 time. So who was born when 911 happened? 2001 Speaker 1 11:26 some people will vaguely remember it. Other people won't. But what is terrifying is that those that were pregnant during their first trimester when 911 happened, and were in and around that experience. Some of them now have grandchildren. Unknown Speaker 11:47 So for those of us in 2001 Unknown Speaker 11:52 anyway, so they now have families. Unknown Speaker 11:55 Those grandchildren at the time of Speaker 1 12:00 birth are around 40% more likely to be diagnosed with PTSD because their grandma was in 911 so if the mother, her mother, experienced a stressor In the third trimester, and you are the grandbaby, you are probably going to get PTSD. So you know about generational trauma that's kind of come up more recently. It's because of studies like this, things that your grandparents went through, things that your grandparents, grandparents come through, went through, absolutely affects how you process and your trajectory today in a very real, very measurable Unknown Speaker 12:48 way. We only have just found this out, just Speaker 4 12:51 kind of really cool that we now can do that. Just to clarify, how do they like, if this is what they get, how do they account for variables like genetics or being raised by someone, so they just looked it's not the environment growing up with them over the Speaker 1 13:09 ground. So epigenetics, we don't know how much genetics comes into this. So is it just that core stress that facing those physiological conditions, like the changes in chemical changes in hormones, performance, at the time of that third trimester. All of those are the things that then change the expression exactly as you said, that changed the expression at that time in that carrying lover. You then had that baby change that gene expression for time of birth. So nothing that happened subsequently, and then that was carried on as basically the genetic expression of time. So we don't quite like we're not sure what this actual mechanism is, but we know that it's there. So now that you can identify the genes that are more prevalent in expression for those that have PTSD, we can see that they're not expressed in these babies two generations later, and they work, for example, three generations. And we can tie it all down to 911 Unknown Speaker 14:00 which is just like insane and Speaker 1 14:03 very cool. But basically, when you then look at this, the very fabric of nature and realities, all of you in this room, to some extent, will disagree on the very fabric of reality, right? You do not have to answer this question. But does anyone in here feel comfortable sharing whether or not they believe in a deity? A deity created Unknown Speaker 14:35 the world, versus Big Bang Theory, science created the world? Speaker 1 14:41 Does anyone have strong opinions? Well, sure, there are a few. But this year, you might all just think the same thing. Who thinks science has more rewards in how we are? Unknown Speaker 14:57 Who's not sure? Totally fine to be not sure. And Speaker 1 15:02 then those that aren't video and answer, but like, how you approach your literal reality will depend on like, how you see the world. It will depend on research, research. It will depend how you look at someone decide whether or not they are worthy of punishment or forgiveness, or like, whether they're inherently evil, right? If that is inherently different in each of us, what do you think that does work? Forensic Psychology, true, right? If you're a psychologist and you believe that some people are born evil, are you going to sign a piece of paper that says someone will be rehabilitated? If you're a forensic psychologist who believes in like, retribution, that's going to be super different. If you believe in that procedural justice, if you think that people should be forgiven and are capable of like, changing their linear good life after it doesn't harmful. You might sign that release storm, but you don't want to do that necessarily. If you believe that you're inherently evil, but also about yourself, if you are someone that believes in forgiveness, and everyone is worthy of forgiveness, whether or not you think that's gonna have an impact on you, will change how you deal with someone if you don't care, and you're like, devil, come get me. You're not going to care what you do to people as much or for the same reasons. So where you sit on a potentiality spectrum, it's really important. I want to introduce this sale Unknown Speaker 16:32 on relevance. Yes, this is a Stephen Speaker 1 16:36 Hawking, awesome. Yeah, of course, this is variables and syntax. Yeah. Boring. You. Okay, Speaker 2 16:43 do you want to explain what this is? Yeah, um, I think I don't think it was him talking. Was it him talking? Yeah, it was. But I remember reading this in his Unknown Speaker 16:55 he wrote about it in his brief history time, Speaker 2 17:00 but basically he was talking about, like, the earth and, like, how that works, and then, well, and then he was cool, yeah. So the presenter was talking about, like, science stuff, basically, and then this lady in the crowd was like, this, like, she was like, no, like, there's, we live on the back of a turtle, basically. And then he, like, the presenter, just kept, like, asking her questions about the turtle. And she was like, he was like, Okay, so like, what's under the turtle? And then she's, apparently, she said, basically, another turtle. And then, so that whole thing went from him talking about like science around the earth to like her explaining to him that she believed that we were on top of an infinite stack of turtles. And yeah, can you just Speaker 1 18:02 prove it? Yeah, right. Which is hilarious, by the way. The funniest experience is when you arrive at Cambridge and you walk into a restaurant and Stephen Hawking is sitting there getting absolutely lit. And that happened, he was like, over at the Roger, and he's just hiding down the line. It's actually anyway, so crazy came. This was William Jason that then he came speak about, and you're exactly right. So it was basically this conversation of like, and exactly Unknown Speaker 18:39 that is that is that someone says, Well, Speaker 1 18:43 picture this just for a moment, right? Can all of you imagine the color purple? Well, Unknown Speaker 18:48 that what it means to you. Any shades. You can pick your shade, just Speaker 1 18:53 your favorite purple. Can you also imagine a mountain? Unknown Speaker 18:59 Can you picture of purple mountain. Unknown Speaker 19:04 Does a purple mountain exist on Earth? Speaker 1 19:08 Interesting, have we explored all of Earth, including under the oceans? So do we know for sure that a purple mountain does not exist? Interesting, lawyers in the room. This is your time. This is small. This is reasonable doubt. Can you imagine that this thing exists? If yes, then I'm done, right? Unknown Speaker 19:33 This what this turned out to? How many know, how many noises Unknown Speaker 19:40 it might be, we might be wrong, Speaker 1 19:44 and the minute you put that down in someone's head, suddenly their whole world falls apart, and the inner child was controlling all of us. This is really problematic, but it spoke to a wider point of this, questions like this. Now, if you are a lawyer, you live for this. If you are an academic, you live with this, and everyone else has to avoid it. Does anyone know about things like this, infinite regression, spiders? Speaker 2 20:16 Well, oh, just Well, yeah, it's like a cause and effect sort of thing. They're like, they cause each other, but the chicken leg has, like a legitimate answer, no, it's the egg. It is objectively interesting. Speaker 1 20:36 There's a regular person. Interesting. There's a paper that was done here that proved that the only way filming a chicken egg, the only way you can produce a chicken egg, is from the expression of protein that only a chicken in its current evolutionary form can produce. So therefore, chicken had to evolve to produce the current chicken egg. It's protein, right? Isn't this interesting. It's like the whole style, actually. Why are we talking about you can break people's arguments apart, which means you can also break research apart. You can break knowledge apart, right? Which is kind of a cool skill to have if you're a really argumentative teenager. Good for you. Metaphysics is basically the title of physics. It's like this meta stuff, right? We don't know. We don't know that there aren't certain so therefore we just cost bust out your knowledge. This my lawyers. Oh, we hate you. My argument doesn't have to be valid. Your sin has to be invalid. This is like prosecutors, 101, I don't have to prove anything. I just have to prove there might be doubt. I don't have to give you a good explanation. I just have to pick apart yours and show you that it sucks. That is it. And this is also academics. They won't give you a good answer. They'll just tell you that you're wrong. But this is also true in that forensic psychology, if a psychologist comes along and disagrees with another psychologist, they don't have to say why. They don't say, No, I don't think it's this. I think it's this. They just say, I don't know. And annoyingly, forensic psychology exists in the exclusively important so if you have a forensic psychologist that comes along and says, Well, actually, based on this science, or based on these things that we know about further psychology, or based on what we know now about genetic factors, actually, my man over there, you know, maybe, maybe there is a chance that they will cry. So exciting. I love, you know, science and they pass a different sentence. It's really interesting. These, I'm not going to go into, but basically, these are arguments where it rests upon something else that you haven't answered so you just begun, you're introducing a question, placing it on your answer like that's really frustrating. Things out responses are like foundations and coherentism. These are our boys who are like, Guys, come on when we leave here forever, we've got to have some ground rules. And it's basically a foundation for knowledge that you can all accept exist or you have a coherent foundation. It can get a little bit messy, because coherent is a mind look like. Can everyone imagine a leopard? Can everyone imagine it raining? It raining is based on a foundation. So you have empirically experienced rain, and you have empirically seen a leopard. So you can imagine a leopard in the rain. And there's empiricism. You get two foundations of knowledge that even COVID, validated in the basic confinement, that's what that is. And they're kind of cool. They're kind of chill, where, like, I'm not into this. However, you then get these people. They basically say that no matter what knowledge we generate, no matter what problem we're looking at, no matter what research we're looking at, no matter what diagnosis, what diagnosis we're looking at, you have two issues, and it all comes down to the criteria. So either you get the meticulous and they basically say your what is invalid, and then you have the members who say your How is invalid. So what that might look like is, I know what it's like to sit on a chair, Unknown Speaker 24:24 your mechanisms will say, how do you know Speaker 1 24:29 that? Because I understand, I think therefore I am. Basically that is what this comes to us. But how today girls, I think therefore I am. It's all of this. How stuff like, Well, how do you know you're sitting on a chair? What is just a fitment of your imagination? Particularly important patients who have psychology says, How do we know their reality isn't the real reality? How do you distinguish between what they're actually seeing, what they think they're feeling super, super fast, but what they're really on it. They go, but how do you that's the chair? What if that's not a chair? What if I just change the name of it? Does the experience don't hold so they look at like the what, as opposed to the hat? So you get these with people, the skeptics, again, these are our social defectors. You just think of both wrong. You always have problems. I can't be bothered to argue with you. So essentially, you then get this now, you will understand by this point that there are disabilities and types of knowledge and reality. We will all hold a position. We will all think a certain way. I might believe more in like genetic influence. You might believe more in environmental influence. That changes my diagnosis that changes how life claiming someone is to get better, right? Although not someone is something because they're inherently evil or because the situation was compliant according to have your choice. So what you start to have is positionality, and that's essentially where we're going to sit like the rest of today. When you establish your own positionality as individuals, it will make it easier for you to conduct research, but also to critically analyze, and that's why I survived the start. No matter which subjects you come from, this is important, because if you don't know your own positionality, you're not a particularly good professional thinker. You need to know that around that another paradigms, I won't be long yet, but there was this dude who was like the paradigm scientist, and he basically said, this is not enough. You also need to make sure the methods through which you allies love align with each other. So for example, and we're going to go through this in positionality. So it's a spectrum, basically, and what you'll have is you will have people, and this is where we get into your integrity. So I know it is the answer for one of you hard times who believes that true knowledge can be generated by science. That is to say, those things that can be falsified and replicated, lab based experiments should hold primacy. Who thinks that true reality? How we measure reality should come down to some lab experiments, genetics, things you can test, who believes that awesome? Who thinks that reality is inherently subjective? What you think is what you believe, awesome you see here you sit even between who you are, totally different, spectrum, Unknown Speaker 27:39 like, totally different. Speaker 1 27:41 So if someone wants to potentially argue a case study, and we'll go through this in a bit more detail, there was a dude who was peed by a statement. There was a guy who was found with paedophilic tendencies. He was arrested because he was accessing he deferred it. According to this guy, he was like, hmm, never been my thing. I don't know why, but about a year ago, I suddenly had this overwhelming urge to be attracted to children. I have no idea now, of course, his wife was like, skeptical, so she referred to it, and she went to the police, and she was like, there's a problem here for this guy, and the police get his picture from aboard. And he said, I swear to you, Unknown Speaker 28:34 like it's not, Speaker 1 28:36 it's not, I don't know what's going on. So they referred him eventually to some medical practitioners, and they gave him a scan, and a neurologist found a four centimeter tumor in his brain. They removed the tumor. This guy was no longer adjusting children back to his hotel. He was like, Yeah, that was weird and all right, but I'm now fine, fast forwarding about seven years So seven years, suddenly getting these urges again, and this time he went to his wife and looks like his back, there's a problem. Re refers another tumor in the same part of the brain. And we now know that there are certain brain regions that, if they are impaired, can do these really want things like change who you're attracted to sexually. Nothing to review their personality correctly. Everything to do whether or not So who thinks it not based on that, but before I told you that story, who would say that? Like, for example, your desired beliefs, who you're attracted to, what behaviors you think around, who thinks it, but that's based on how you have brought up, or just early exposures, or whatever, before I told you about it, okay, who thinks this thing brings at birth or biologically. Does anyone want to share a word? Because, again, super, Speaker 3 30:11 super slick. This is my, my specific relationship. This is, this is literally my specific interest, where we do not have free will in our relationships, and I've spent a lot of time thinking about neuroscience and endocrinology. I've spent a lot of time in the science world. So I mean, I mean, it's literally the thing that I have hyper focused on for the last 20 years, and I think that there are many places where we have some free will to change who and what we are attracted to, and there are many places where we don't have choice based on our Based on our hormones, based on our biology, based on the chemistry in our brains, based on just, I mean, if you want to hack yourself out of what you're really attracted to, you're going to spend Your life really challenged by that. But you can, yeah, I mean, the there's, there's an aspect to, if you learned abuse was love in your childhood, then you likely will, and that's one of the things that you can kind of hack yourself out of. But like you're, you know, there's markers in the brain around hetero and homosexuality. There's, it's just, it's just a hot mess in there. So Unknown Speaker 31:44 can you separate out Speaker 1 31:47 personality from physical appearance? Like, what happens when you get people who are just like, let's say, is that because they're more Unknown Speaker 31:59 attractive to personality? Attractive personality, Speaker 3 32:05 and that holds more of a weight overhead. No, I think that there's like, a lot of like we have. I stopped going into like, the whole like, nerdy parts of it. It's like we have our senses are picking up on a lot of things constantly. And so depending on what age you are as well, it also depends on what you're attracted to. So if you're in a very fertile place in your cycle versus, you know, I mean, it's, it's, it's really a lot of genetics. So not really super interesting Unknown Speaker 32:42 anyone. Else? Well, I think Speaker 2 32:46 my family, I feel like it's very like interesting, because there's three of us brothers, and then there's, it's, I have a stepdad and and then, like, genetic like, when I was younger, I looked exactly like my father, and I still kind of look more like him than I do my mom, and we have effectively the same personality, and then it's the same for my mom and my older brother and my younger brother and my stepdad and they all, we all look almost exactly like and act almost exactly like our like counterpart parent. But also I had this funny example of a I was like, scrolling on Instagram or something, and I saw a video of this comedian, and I personally found her somewhat attractive, and I immediately looked at the like, there was this thing at the bottom of your page that says, Who follows that account? And it was my father. Unknown Speaker 33:55 And I feel like, Speaker 2 33:56 like, in terms of like, I have a, like, a very open relationship with my dad. We talk about like, he's, he's a divorced, 50 something year old guy so and so he's like, he's very cool with my brother and I, who are now adults, talking about that stuff with them. And from what I can tell, we have very similar tastes in partners and in like, just like friends and just like the way we interact with the world. Like, um Yeah, it's like, I struggle a lot more to communicate with my stepdad or my mom than I do with my dad. But it's the same for like, my older brother, who's like my mom, they get along way better. Not that we don't like, I don't hate my parents, yeah, but like, I feel like, like I am, like, at least like, yeah, we're it's just like the personalities and stuff. Like my stepdad is a is a lawyer, and is not only is that the argument stuff is so annoying. Unknown Speaker 35:09 No, yeah, but that's what he's good at, and that's Speaker 2 35:15 like, I he argues with me about, like, stuff that I studied currently in school that he's never heard of, and regardless of how like objectively, right I am, you feel wrong, right, when you're in an argument with them. Speaker 2 35:34 The thing is, my, my little brother is his son, yeah, and so, oh, I see you arguing with you regardless of he's an eight year old, so he doesn't know anything like he he has opinions, and he has very strong opinions, and he's very good at arguing, but he doesn't have any facts. But it's like, it's, it's ironic how frustrating it is to argue with this eight year old and feel like you're being crushed because he's just, he's just a, like, a tiny little lawyer running around, even though he's just objectively wrong about, like, most things that he says. But it's yeah, it's like, I don't know my my whole family has this like, yeah, yeah. But it's like a specific, like, you can see that, like, that personality is like a direct copy of because, like, yeah, of that. Like, it didn't my mom, because my brother and I, yeah, we were never like, that argumentative as children who is familiar with Unknown Speaker 36:52 California. Can you name the he Speaker 1 37:02 is, has written books called behave and determined, and he's basically an evolutionary biologist. And this guy is convinced with every fiber of his being that none of us have free will over anything. The difficulty is he's an absolute Don, and the way that he like presents some of those lectures just makes me leave like, it's unreal. He really interesting person. His lectures are on YouTube. He would be a super interesting person who's gone watch because you might end up leaving being like, all right, maybe Bob's old or something, right? You might go listen to someone else and think differently. Who here thinks that actually things like our interests, who we're attracted to, maybe our disposition for life, anger or emotion or expression, has nothing to do with biology, and it's a lot more to do with how you were brought up, or the lessons that you exposed to in the environment than you were in. Does anyone think it's more to do with that? Maybe because you're super dissimilar to a parent or Unknown Speaker 38:10 both? You think is Unknown Speaker 38:13 definitely like have a lot of relationships Speaker 1 38:18 with biology, but present experience does, sure, I mean, and that still goes on. This is what the binary answer. Okay, so you're all sort of super young, but like, has anyone been in a relationship where you've been in that relationship and then you turned around, like, two years later? That's not necessarily because your genetics have changed. You just learn these things, and maybe you're attracted to that type of person. Maybe that's a conscious choice. Or maybe you're just like, absolutely right. Might happen. So it's not entirely missing your biology. It's not like, oh wow, looks like I got a day back higher. Let's do but like when you're what's really Speaker 3 39:06 well, what's really exciting, and I'm in this is just a really personal share, is that, as I I was just diagnosed with a an autoimmune disease that is literally has to do with my hormones, and though things have shifted in who I'm attracted to, no way, and person and my obviously my personality. So like this idea that when women go through menopause, because it's it's not that something magical is happening. It's just like they're no longer producing a certain in there, so they're not as like their their brain chemistry shifts, and the not just like the physical expressions of their body, but like, like how their neurology shifts with their their hormones and their chemicals and things like that. So it's like, in the last six months, I'm like, something's weird because I'm changing, and the people that I'm attracted to are changing. So Unknown Speaker 40:04 something's up. No, Speaker 3 40:07 it's no no, because I'm still even my learned lessons I was still attracted to the same kind of trash people. Speaker 1 40:15 Does anyone? So just, Unknown Speaker 40:28 does anyone know where from California? I've never heard of this, Speaker 2 40:40 right? It's one sir, basically, it's like, right, and right in this moment you go through this, like, unbelievable Unknown Speaker 40:55 transformation. Unknown Speaker 41:02 Now the thing is, what I Speaker 1 41:05 will say is that certainly for biological women, the age of 27 is the point in which your brain goes through kind of its last significant transition before you hit that menopausal stage and suddenly should me, and you're like, Okay, I'm starting to see things a little bit different. Their lives are true for everyone. Obviously, it's not even using the person, but the brain is sort of going through periods of development. This is not to say like other areas, but significant changes that we can match areas that's a really important age that doesn't necessarily map across biological men, their development is slightly different in their key brain regions. Speaker 3 41:50 Does this also have to do with how many like eggs that a woman is using? I Unknown Speaker 42:00 don't know. Do you mean well, well, yeah, Speaker 3 42:06 it's like a fertility thing. So it's like, how many like menstruation cycles a woman goes through, like shifts? I kind of like, Unknown Speaker 42:25 I was gonna say, also with like, just the Speaker 2 42:29 like, I feel like you've all kind of experienced, like, some change, like, in who we're attracted to, like, when you were younger, you're most likely attracted to someone who is roughly your age. And then as you get older, it comes up with you, at least to some level, Unknown Speaker 42:46 yeah, some people, Speaker 2 42:51 yeah. So it's like, I feel like, and all that is like puberty and like, a ton of hormones and all that other stuff that changes. And so I feel like it's like that, like, there's obviously, I feel like we've all experienced some, like, biological changes to ourselves that attain the way we see different people, or even, like, our behaviors are more like complex after, like, yeah, like having an eight year old, his logic and reasoning is Like, four and eight year old. It's amazing. But, well, no, he's just, he's just interesting, because it's like, I keep you forget what it what it's like when you're that age, and then when it's back, like, when you get to, like, experience it through his life again, then it's like, it makes sense, where he's like, he has his thoughts are just not as complicated or whatever, because he's eight, right? And so it's like, all that change, all those changes are going to come, he's not going to notice. Saying, no, yeah. So it's like, I feel like we've all experienced just a little, at least to some extent, some biological change that was like, change our personality or other things about us. I feel like it's like, it's something we don't necessarily like think about on a daily basis, but it's like, yeah, it just does happen. Yeah. Speaker 1 44:18 Biological sub trajectory that will set the time of birth, and like, how much that can change in Australia, none of us really know right? We don't know whether or not each person is going to reach maturity at like 21 or like 31 or for some people, like 61 and how that affects you, and the decisions that you make, and then what you do in circumstances and situations, and how that lends itself to your behavior, your choices, that's really important. And you can battle the others. There's so much of it comes down, which is why I think you sit within Unknown Speaker 44:52 the spectrum, right, but in particular positionality. Unknown Speaker 44:56 So this one Speaker 1 44:57 is basically, think this is like the far right of a belief spectrum. So by show of hands, who believes that everything, knowledge, reality, etc, is all relative. It's all subjective. My reality in your reality, is completely distinct, but they're both valid in their own way. But my reality is not right compared to yours. It's just subjective. It's totally relative. Who kind of thinks they might you change your mind so you can commit early. Who thinks it might be kind of takes a more relative position, boundary, relativism, you kind of move a bit along. So it's like your realities are different, but they're kind of like bounded within certain context, so you can't take it and just like say, you know, fair enough floating around and telling everyone the reality is balanced, you can say that there are certain things that you can rule out as a kind of not being bad at any inherently quite wrong. And that's kind of founded. Does anyone think things are kind of founded in that way? Subjective reality is still important and supports reality, but it depends on some context, critical realism. I'm gonna come to it again, so I'll switch the other end to the naive realism. Decent people just later saying, Yeah, look, we all have our reality. We're all subjective. We all have our beliefs. But fundamentally, what really matters is what I can measure. So like, you know, you might think that you're an element, if you're genetic, some of you're not that you can kind of park that subject to reality. You can park that separately, somewhere else. And actually what you can measure, what is true knowledge, not opinion knowledge. What is true knowledge is anything you can measure in those kind of objective ways. Structuralism is the same what we can measure. However, this one is like, Yeah, but there are structures that inherently dictate which knowledge is measured. So, like, just because the University of Cambridge has found that, like, this thing is true or this genetic thing has happened, that's only because they got funding to find that out, because they're the University of Cambridge, and actually, just because they've found that out doesn't mean there is a knowledge out there that exists that could, like, falsify that we just don't know that. So we sort of like, yeah, science is important, sure, but there are other factors in that that kind of dictate what science gets found and which doesn't. There's a structure to it. Does anyone have the capacity awesome? Then you have this boom critical realism. There are elements of human knowledge where it's like, yeah, there are really some bits that you think are like, based on biology and you measure it. And there's objective values. However, there is subjective realities, and that is still important, right? How many people probably sit in that area? Yeah, it's pretty it's pretty common. It's pretty secondary position. And then you have paradise you want to go and look at some further readings. These are where I would go, especially in 1962 Thomas says, Well, go and have a look at this. This can just serve you. Well no matter what you do, it's really Unknown Speaker 48:18 interesting. So Unknown Speaker 48:21 you normally use that do Unknown Speaker 48:22 so Speaker 1 48:25 essentially, the paradigm section is how the organization section, or this is separate children's positionality that you as an individual have to align with it, right? So let's just use a really good example, if you are someone that sits on the side that, for example, everything in the world, all knowledge, all reality, can be measured objectively, biologically, genetically, through science, whatever that might be. Why would you go and study something on their, say, critical race theory? Because people's opinions might be interesting, but that isn't generating knowledge in your mind. So if you are the person going to do that, it kind of opposes each other. It doesn't really align. And that's important, because as individuals, you carry biases, and those biases hit onto your research, to your life, your clinical practice, super important to have reminded me. Interesting. I will send you these. This is a when you're looking at research and your research Unknown Speaker 49:26 realization Speaker 1 49:27 and your assessment, your decision. This is critical thinking. So when you're reading something and you're writing to me with your dissertations, and you're saying, this is a really strong argument, I'll go with that right if I think that apart, your art doesn't work. So if you can take a piece of research or piece of information, and you can say, this is kind of where I align, and this time doesn't seem to make sense, and I see where they're coming from, and therefore it's like valid research, Unknown Speaker 49:56 right? I can't argue Speaker 1 49:58 with that. So just bear that in mind, and I'll also pop this on there, so you can just have on our and I also put this on there, so you can just have an idea of how certain research and knowledge. So like, you know, prime Unknown Speaker 50:11 example might be this. Those are critical Speaker 1 50:13 artists. The whole world, the whole of reality, depends on video, power Unknown Speaker 50:18 and structure and authority, Unknown Speaker 50:22 right down a little Speaker 1 50:24 they tend to be in this area of things. They look at this little Christian discourse, all knowledge of generated by the media left handed in this section here, right so that is just a super, super quick understanding of what decisionality is Unknown Speaker 50:45 and why it matters. Speaker 1 50:48 So for the last like 20 minutes ago, why there's anything within that space you think is a waterfall that's really Wright to you to base it with each other, speak to each other and work out where you sit differently. Is there anything we've discussed on any forensic psychology or criminology problem that really interests you as a person? And you always go, oh, okay, interesting that you just talk about Anyone, anyone making Oh, Unknown Speaker 51:35 just talking shit. Speaker 3 51:41 I'm curious the spectrum in the room of people who think people are good and people who think people are inherently bad, inherently good and Unknown Speaker 51:49 inherently bad, compared to not Unknown Speaker 51:52 inherently good. Yeah, I mean good people. Speaker 3 51:59 Also, I find that in the world, this is what I find. But I don't have that belief. I've spent a lot of time looking at people. People are neither good or bad, they're people. People have strategies to get their needs met, and some of them are really effective, and some of them hurt themselves or other people, and some of them just shit in general. And so people Muslim, oh, particularly, wildly less racist. And Speaker 3 52:37 so it's not a lot of the time. It's not a conscious strategy. Oftentimes it's either biological or an unconscious thing that they've learned, or some childhood manipulation that they learned about how to see the world and how to get Unknown Speaker 52:52 their smile. Yeah. So three Speaker 1 52:54 options show of hands. The three options are supposed to be people are inherently good, people are inherently bad, and people are neither. It's kind of situation. So does anyone think people are inherently Unknown Speaker 53:15 anyone think that people are inherently bad? Kind of neither, and Unknown Speaker 53:23 it's just interesting another chance. Speaker 1 53:31 Does everyone think that everyone in the room is capable of committing an atrocity, a serious harm, something truly heinous, if situation presents. Unknown Speaker 53:45 Anyone thinks there are some that Unknown Speaker 53:50 would make sense to be inherently good, interesting. Speaker 1 53:54 So this is a real this is such an interesting concept because yesterday, I was lecturing masters policing students who are all officers, and there's a ton of American officers on the course, and one of them came up to me and was like, I want to do a research project. Tell me your idea. He said, I research what happens to a cop after he killed. Unknown Speaker 54:28 How are you Unknown Speaker 54:30 talking about? But this is Speaker 1 54:37 just kind of goes through by something, or is there, like other people who said, Yeah, I find this. The next thing, he's still someone, Okay, interesting. And he said the guy was running, he thought wasteful. And I'm like, wow, okay, but the way in which he was speaking about this problem was like, Oh, okay. You're really chill with this, you're kind of like, cool. So because police, here's my thing, it's my area of interest, who thinks but when? So police officers do bad things. When talking about bad, as in misconduct or, like, abuse of power, we're talking about bad in the sense that if anyone else did it, and they were Unknown Speaker 55:25 considered pretty badly, you shot someone, Unknown Speaker 55:29 but in the license they do that, Unknown Speaker 55:33 who thinks you adopt? Speaker 1 55:36 Who thinks people become police officers? Because, to begin with, they're kind of very aware that they might have to do that, and they are chill with shooting someone. And option two is, who thinks that the training in the environment and the culture and the kind of build up of use of force over time and the exposure means Unknown Speaker 55:58 then people kind of do it Speaker 3 56:00 and kind of adjust. You got two options, Can I Can I ask some clarify, a clarifying question, is this person researching, studying people like the police force in the UK, the US and so in the US and or anywhere else in the world like Unknown Speaker 56:27 us. So this is not a Unknown Speaker 56:31 specific thing, because it's just essentially Speaker 1 56:35 people that go and do something that, objectively, we might think is like pretty bad. So we're taking out the fact that doing that might mitigate another harm, which in theory is what should happen. Doesn't work like that in practice, necessarily. But who thinks that people join, for example, the police, knowing that they're going to particularly have to use equal force, and that they're okay with that. So there is this self selection, who thinks that happens, who that people join, not really reconciling the fact they might have to do that. But then culture and the environment kind of makes them okay with it. Interesting. That's super, super interesting. I actually didn't accept that suddenly here, if we all smile in Cambridge, everyone's like, it matters. Like police versus like. I think this is my other perspective. But like, ICE Unknown Speaker 57:40 agents, when I sign up to part of the ice right now, Speaker 1 57:44 yeah? Like, if you sign up to be a fire officer from day one, yeah, like, you probably want to use them. So what about like, that's just another element, because why are you using the case study the military? Unknown Speaker 58:01 The military, it's a different one, lucky for you, Speaker 1 58:06 on the entire structure of policing and how it works, even though it's most interesting, but I think, but the military Speaker 1 58:20 and we will use this as a case study. So policing is super difficult to assess, because there are different roles across the world, right? We have three primary roles of policing. We have the UK, which is a divorce system, so each area you are covered by force, they themselves be covered by professional practices, but like, they have their own, really employed by your state legal counsel, right? So right now we're covered by Cambridgeshire, different officers, different areas. Super interestingly, you've got, like, this little triangle which intersects four forces. What's hilarious is that if you're in pursuit of someone and you hit the County border, you need those officers to come and join in, otherwise they just go away. And like in this little triangle, there's so many burglaries, because it's underneath a spyware there are four horses, and none of them can intervene. Hilarious, but anyway, you then have us sisters. How many people know? How many policing organizations were offered either our own? Many people know how many policing organizations? Roughly, there are in the US, yes. So in the UK, we have 45 territorial Speaker 3 59:38 forces wait policing structures, meaning like we're like the structure itself, or like individual states and things like that. Oh, okay, Unknown Speaker 59:51 hold on. Let me how Unknown Speaker 59:59 many might be just eight might be something Unknown Speaker 1:00:06 I know. Hold on, mommy, 1200 high or low. Who Unknown Speaker 1:00:14 thinks about 1200 I would anyone. 400 Speaker 1 1:00:21 pool. Anyone think lower, okay, anyone think higher, but in little bit, so let's say 3000 anyone, 5000 anyone, Unknown Speaker 1:00:29 10,000 Okay, so 7000 6000 Unknown Speaker 1:00:36 Okay, 6000 is our highest. Okay, Speaker 1 1:00:43 so 6000 is our highest. Do you know the wildest thing? No one knows. Nobody or globally, has sat down and thought we should probably document how many leasing organizations or agencies. No one's known that. But at last count, over 18,000 Yeah, with jurisdiction. The interesting thing to see that model is just a complex model. So you have, like, the mayor's office, wildly police officers who represent, like a state can also be hired privately by the mayor, and then they work on bridges because work station. What French system? This is our Unknown Speaker 1:01:28 third system, gendarme. There another Speaker 1 1:01:31 arms. The French have got two systems, a little bit like if you just have sex, so you've got a policing force armed. And then each region has its own local force. So that's kind of how it works. You've got a British model, just one thing that's before. You've got a French model, which is kind of, you've got the Men at Arms, and then you've got do what you want. You do have them like another which is like the Irish model, which is just one police force in the whole country, I think it's still regionalized. It's super interesting because of those in the world, it's really hard for us to know and like assess the political Unknown Speaker 1:02:17 justice Speaker 1 1:02:20 system if you start military, let's take the British army. Do you reckon it's a very good bet? You know what you're signing up for. This is not, I might go into firearms. I might be like, What are you doing in the military? What might be some of them, other than going to war, what might be the only Unknown Speaker 1:02:40 military do? The other Unknown Speaker 1:02:43 Air Force is often called the chair force in the US, because you don't Speaker 1 1:02:50 actually do anything like that. So you could want strong benefits to be a part of that community, gain respect and potentially greater career opportunities down the line while doing something like, obviously, pretty cool anymore right Unknown Speaker 1:03:13 Now, but like exactly, so we're just Unknown Speaker 1:03:19 talking like I Unknown Speaker 1:03:24 like, paying for school. Speaker 1 1:03:26 Interesting, yeah, really, really good point. That's such an interesting point, wildly like in the like this last year, there have been, like, this odd bump that we saw people signing up to join the police Unknown Speaker 1:03:41 and then with you leaving it near. And everyone Speaker 1 1:03:45 went and was like, why are you leaving any training? Like, why is this? And they're basically like, because you pay better than any other job. I get to sit in the classroom for seven months learn all this stuff and then leave. I never actually have to be a police officer. It's better than any other summer job. Hilarious, like most ingenious, terrible, what might be the other motivations? Um, well, I am in the US. This is a personal story. Also, um, someone that's really close to this land, the proper legal Speaker 6 1:04:13 documents for a family member. Speaker 1 1:04:22 Um, yeah, they don't want to be there. They're like, forced single in the US, especially, Unknown Speaker 1:04:30 they're doing it out Speaker 1 1:04:36 of necessity. Yeah. I mean, that's kind of the basic data that for a long time, you'll see this, like it's just necessities. So, like, we're not going at the Air Force. We just kind of like go around, like British, but like army, what might be using the army? You join any military right or any tradition. Why would you join the army for any other reason? The knowing footnote, Speaker 4 1:05:11 you're there for war. Okay, I don't know if this is still Speaker 1 1:05:14 a work around. And I answer your question Speaker 4 1:05:17 building off of the paying for school, I think, like, a really, really big one is paying for medical school. Okay, there's lots of doctors that just get to, like, be a doctor on the base, for people who are in the military, and you're like, military person, but you're just basically being a doctor in a specific Speaker 7 1:05:35 setting, yeah, you probably go anywhere. Speaker 1 1:05:40 So very good work on take out, like the doctors, the lawyers, the Unknown Speaker 1:05:49 dentist, Speaker 1 1:05:52 the teachers, like those that training with a gun for like 11 months. That's like day. That's what we do. You're like, you know for one thing you're getting done. What would you really do? Yeah, yeah, Unknown Speaker 1:06:05 like honor, honor based careers, people joining Unknown Speaker 1:06:12 me to COVID. Just definitely, Unknown Speaker 1:06:29 is, Unknown Speaker 1:06:33 I was gonna say, like, patriotism, Unknown Speaker 1:06:37 really big in the US. Speaker 2 1:06:39 It's kind of similar to, like, the legacy thing too, but it's like, it's like a Yeah, like, if your dad was like an American, of course, yeah, that's yeah. Does Speaker 1 1:06:56 anyone here think that anyone who joined the army is nominated in the Air Force being conscious that they might go to war and someone. Yes, anyone think that anyone is not aware of that? I know I'm being triggered on this, but like, does anyone think at any point, Unknown Speaker 1:07:20 show of hands. Who thinks yes circumstances, Speaker 1 1:07:30 but like Does anyone here think that people who are happy to sign up to the military knowing they may have to go and shoot someone Unknown Speaker 1:07:39 are worse Unknown Speaker 1:07:40 people are more harmful, let's Speaker 1 1:07:44 say not to go down. So very good question. Does anyone think that people are generally speaking, more harmful or more willing to do harm? Let's let's go down those two so it can become more willing to do harm or more harmful generally. Unknown Speaker 1:08:06 Does anyone think if Speaker 1 1:08:09 you join that you are more willing to do harm? Unknown Speaker 1:08:15 Interesting. So does anyone inherently more harmful. Speaker 1 1:08:29 Does anyone think anyone who joins the police is more willing than those not? Unknown Speaker 1:08:39 That's a difficult Speaker 1 1:08:40 one, because then it's like, well, what's the military therefore, and what's the police effort, right? It comes out as fundamental. So the reason this is just because one of your cases upcoming, and you can compare, this is going to be a case study of marine a Has anyone heard of Unknown Speaker 1:09:03 this? So Speaker 1 1:09:05 marine a was a British jury, and this has been big in the forensic psychology space. A big Unknown Speaker 1:09:13 marine a Speaker 1 1:09:15 was in Afghan and basically what happened is they came under attack when they were out on patrol. And there Unknown Speaker 1:09:26 was another that was kind of shocking. Speaker 1 1:09:30 And marine a along with several of his colleagues, went and the first rule of war, certainly by what we live by here, is that you try to save the life of any injured person, including it. So what should have happened is back, shoot this person, marine, go and read up on Unknown Speaker 1:09:52 this case. Decided that was not Unknown Speaker 1:09:53 going to happen, and he went around longer, Unknown Speaker 1:10:01 and he shot his barren head, and he said, Boys, I've Unknown Speaker 1:10:04 just broken the gene convention Unknown Speaker 1:10:08 for several years since has been on trial for murder. Huge. The Speaker 1 1:10:16 question to debate, and then we'll allocate you on site. Is Unknown Speaker 1:10:23 that murder? Or is that not Speaker 1 1:10:28 so based on that case alone, the reason that is important that case, you'll find out is because that person had a history of surgery, history of duty. They there are facts about how long they could be in a door zone, all of these different components that fundamentally contribute to whether or not this person committed murder and going to be one of, if not the first case study that we look at now, of course, that case study, obviously it's charged with that. It obviously touches a lot on conditions of law. We will focus it down onto like the courts and criminal justice system. If anyone talking about the case or researching that case, please email me, because you obviously won't accept and that goes from a Ford case study, for case studies. You'll explore a threat, but like that one is a super interesting one, because like comes into it now, this cultural difference and like what you fundamentally believe in patriotism or like social whatever it is, all comes in fact. You please go if you want Unknown Speaker 1:11:49 to, because it's super Are you all aware that your Monday lecture hasn't been moved? No, oh Speaker 8 1:11:54 Lord, I was sending you know you have cheese Unknown Speaker 1:12:01 has been moved Monday 445, Speaker 1 1:12:03 I think it was, has been moved. And the 29th of July, which I think is a Tuesday, has also been moved. And then all of you know later to let me know when they're going to be they are moving to like I think, I think one Speaker 1 1:12:27 it's Friday, and another one is like Thursday, 31st maybe also in the evening. Yeah. You Unknown Speaker 1:12:45 actually see you next week. I Speaker 2 1:12:54 Oh, yeah, our cybersecurity class is also he went to Gibraltar. Well, Unknown Speaker 1:13:01 I have Speaker 2 1:13:06 until like the afternoon tomorrow. So we didn't have any class today, and we won't have any Speaker 8 1:13:16 I have London at I have a flight on the first at nine. Unknown Speaker 1:13:41 I don't want to miss them. Unknown Speaker 1:13:49 I just don't want to miss them because I love this. i'm like, oh, you. Unknown Speaker 1:17:10 And I'm gonna actually call you back, because you will be a bigger Unknown Speaker 1:17:14 picture on here than your Ah, Unknown Speaker 1:17:22 let's see. Can I do that? I can do that? Have it, have Unknown Speaker 1:17:27 it grab have it grab you. But why isn't it? Unknown Speaker 1:17:32 Hold on. Let's see what happens. Unknown Speaker 1:17:40 He is I Unknown Speaker 1:17:58 Alas, it did not that Speaker 8 1:18:05 was okay. How you doing? I'm doing this massage chair? It is Speaker 9 1:18:16 the massage chair. I'm like, it's, it seems to be my de facto chair that I go sit in that, yeah. Unknown Speaker 1:18:25 Why would you leave that property, like, I just Unknown Speaker 1:18:30 don't understand. It's like, it's just great, Unknown Speaker 1:18:36 yeah, there's that, right? It's just like, to Unknown Speaker 1:18:39 some ugly bullshit. Unknown Speaker 1:18:46 I mean, I like to know where Speaker 8 1:18:48 people live, but like, no, it seems like okay. If a place like I bet there would be some people. You'd literally have to kick out. You'd Unknown Speaker 1:18:59 have to politely, unpolitely ask to leave. I feel like Speaker 9 1:19:08 I mean, I suppose some people come and stay for a bit, but I feel like, if they just guess, if they're like, long term orbiters of Lori's world, then, yeah, they they extend. You're like, Oh, I'm leaving in the state. And it's like, oh, I have to extend a we do or something. I think she kind of has those orbiters that just kind of extend their stay and extend their stay, but people that just kind of come over, I feel they kind of feel like, I just leave now, they're not like to us in that way. So it's those Unknown Speaker 1:19:42 long term glory friends that are like, their Unknown Speaker 1:19:48 boundaries, yeah, exactly, exactly, Speaker 3 1:19:57 I told my friends about here. I was like, wow, that was a really Trish tailored, uh, flirt, or whatever that was, that's just like a whole analysis or an assessment of yourself by chat. And I was like, that was just really Trish tailored, Unknown Speaker 1:20:16 very nerdy. I was Unknown Speaker 1:20:23 like, Wow. Speaker 9 1:20:26 I I was really just trying to figure out what would be like. The most transparent. I was like, just ask my GP what it thinks about, you know, given a psycho analysis on me, you know, yeah, I guess it can be a bit on the rosy, rosy side, I Speaker 3 1:20:49 suppose. But and then I was like, and then I reread them today, Speaker 8 1:20:52 because I was talking to one of my best friends, and I was like, I really understand really hard to date Speaker 3 1:20:59 me. I kind of feel bad for people I don't know. I just got into wherever it is that I am now to be, so whatever that is to be like, well, technically, Unknown Speaker 1:21:09 chat, GPT is like, and I just Unknown Speaker 1:21:11 like to this thing. And I was like, Unknown Speaker 1:21:12 person's trying to flirt with me, and I am Unknown Speaker 1:21:16 totally in my head about it. This poor person Unknown Speaker 1:21:20 should apologize. Like I had Unknown Speaker 1:21:23 this whole conversation. I was like, What happened to Unknown Speaker 1:21:27 you? Fuck, you're not you're not wrong, Speaker 3 1:21:35 you're not wrong. But that's not we both know that just because in for it's information correct Unknown Speaker 1:21:41 doesn't mean that it's sexy. Speaker 8 1:21:49 I got you, you're just like, oh, or connecting. Speaker 3 1:21:59 And I was like, Is this because my hormones have been changing and I like things are different, or just like, now I'm like, Unknown Speaker 1:22:06 I'm like, so Unknown Speaker 1:22:10 in academia, this is Unknown Speaker 1:22:11 what my brain looks like right now. Or, Speaker 9 1:22:23 anyway, yeah, I, my first, my first wife, was he Unknown Speaker 1:22:33 her degree in physics and biology. Unknown Speaker 1:22:38 That's like, like, humanity is in there. There's no, Unknown Speaker 1:22:42 there's not some softening of that, Unknown Speaker 1:22:45 you know what I mean, like this, Speaker 9 1:22:49 the one before that, that was that seven year was an entomologist. So for whatever reason, I was like, just, just kind of drawn to, like, brainy kind of thing. And then, and then, often times I do, like, do like, little, oh well, you know, this piece of knowledge that I have maybe adjacent to like, Oh no, I don't know. Oh, actually, I don't know. Like, and then, and then being being around getting my graduate degree, and then being Corvallis, and Corvallis has the most amount or of highly educated people. So you just be out casually. I was talking, I'm getting my PhD in XYZ. Oh, okay, yeah, I know about this, about it, that's actually wrong. Speaker 8 1:23:45 Something about higher level degrees, maybe, or or people who there's they're thinking about not Speaker 3 1:23:59 like it, not like being wrong isn't attached to your identity, personality and ego is, like, a really attractive thing in the world. It's like, oh, I actually know anybody like, oh, okay, I can, I can learn and evolve my perspective and my understanding of many people. Speaker 8 1:24:19 I think that that's one of the things that I find really just, Unknown Speaker 1:24:26 oh, Holland, about many Unknown Speaker 1:24:30 Well, I think that, you know, once Speaker 9 1:24:34 I got my master's grade, I was like, oh, so I know a lot about, like, this little thing. I know how off most people are on it. Just imagine how often about, like, pretty much everything else I just know this is like, I think that's the more that you know, and the more specific you know, you realize that just generalized knowledge is not very nuanced. It's often just wrong. And it's just like, just realize, like, Speaker 8 1:25:06 maybe I know that things are changing. Science is constantly changing, or many things are constantly Speaker 3 1:25:16 about anything. I know something about what I was taught now. I know I know other things about human nature and like, dynamics and stuff like that, Unknown Speaker 1:25:25 that's just practical. But like, Speaker 9 1:25:32 Yeah, we don't know practical, right? Yeah, right. There's the practical, like street level knowledge gate situation. Some people don't have it all, just never. I People don't Unknown Speaker 1:25:46 have it all. Just never Unknown Speaker 1:25:51 survive, right? Not bad for someone who Unknown Speaker 1:25:56 said that she had no common sense, though I was Speaker 3 1:26:06 like, You're right, mom. Well, I it took me a long time. I was really hurt by that, but I'm like, now, like, you're she was right. It's not common. Whatever I got isn't common. It's definitely like an ADHD, Unknown Speaker 1:26:17 or is paradise up in here? Well, I Unknown Speaker 1:26:29 Well, my Speaker 9 1:26:31 I didn't really, wasn't really tracking that. It was a nerdy flirt, but you know, I'm glad that you named that so flirt, Speaker 3 1:26:42 let me if I can figure out a way to give Trish a condensed package Unknown Speaker 1:26:49 of information about me, Speaker 8 1:26:54 give her as much knowledge she can that I'm let her make a choice her own. First braces are sexy. I mean, that's Unknown Speaker 1:27:08 how I'm reading it. But whatever, Speaker 9 1:27:16 here's, here's a dossier on Simon. How about that? Just read the file. Oh, man, it Unknown Speaker 1:27:25 was funny. I was like, my friend goes, Unknown Speaker 1:27:28 You're so weird. And I was like, thank you. Unknown Speaker 1:27:34 Flash. I loved it. Speaker 8 1:27:38 We're in your friends, like, oh, that totally makes sense. No, I mean, they were like, You're so weird. And that makes sense to me, Unknown Speaker 1:27:45 not in the like, oh yeah, that's how we're dating. Unknown Speaker 1:27:50 They I mean, I know Speaker 8 1:27:52 that I'm weird. It's not like, it's not like, I'm quiet about that. No, it's not like, I'm like, Oh, I'm weird. Whoa. Like, I'm pretty aware that. Like it takes very people to Speaker 8 1:28:13 yeah, get me, yeah, yeah, yeah. Unknown Speaker 1:28:32 Yeah, I was interested. Unknown Speaker 1:28:37 Oh, what ever label thing? And I was like, oh, Unknown Speaker 1:28:44 label Oh, well, I just Speaker 9 1:28:49 in your comment, I went, and I was like, oh, is the label that you want? Or what is? I forget exactly how I phrased it, but it's like, oh, that's kind of like a straight to the point type of thing, isn't it? And it's like, Oh, okay. Speaker 8 1:29:15 I'm sorry. I'm gonna read it back to you, and you're gonna probably laugh too, but Speaker 3 1:29:21 created a psychological myself, and also just did a full assessment of where I'm at, especially sexually, in conjunction with sage, my chat Unknown Speaker 1:29:31 GPT, that I can share with you the most transparent I can Speaker 3 1:29:37 think about being. I thought that was just really sweet. It just shows like the effort Unknown Speaker 1:29:43 and the desire to want. That's actually Unknown Speaker 1:29:48 a pretty form sentence, without using awesome credit, Speaker 8 1:29:57 that's pretty good. It's pretty good form sentence. Speaker 9 1:30:06 You know, I had, I had dyslexia, like, when I went to college, I have, like, yeah, have Unknown Speaker 1:30:18 one in three. I couldn't Speaker 9 1:30:22 finish a bunch of assignments, and he asked me to go out and do alphabet. So I was like, DC, and then I spelled my name. I'm like, there's letters in there, for sure. XYZ, you're like, there, it's, it's notes in my name. Like, there's couple of Unknown Speaker 1:30:43 loops in there, but, and Unknown Speaker 1:30:46 yeah, verbally is me Unknown Speaker 1:30:48 through ninth grade, first grade, Unknown Speaker 1:30:53 but I was worth anything. Unknown Speaker 1:30:56 I didn't like those Unknown Speaker 1:30:58 living birds and I couldn't I I could, is it Unknown Speaker 1:31:10 still Unknown Speaker 1:31:14 like that look so show up. And Unknown Speaker 1:31:19 I think I just have to be just aware about how Unknown Speaker 1:31:22 doing things. So just Speaker 9 1:31:25 had to train myself on, on how to Unknown Speaker 1:31:33 word play, because, because I Speaker 9 1:31:38 mean things. And then I have to pick, I have to pick. But all of those things go through my head, yeah, and I pick, and then some of them are funny. Like, oh, that's hilarious. Like, yeah, they're just like, but I go through it really quickly, but I'm like, I'm tracking like, the you know, so it's not like, oh, this default, it's going to be this. And it's just like, there's a Randall of answers. And I'm like, yes, it's that one. Then that one's really funny, yeah, yeah, yeah. But it's just like, yeah. This happens really quickly, and I have learn how to just be very, very simple in the way that I've done just simplify Unknown Speaker 1:32:22 it. Simplify it. Simplify it. Just so could write, well, yeah, Speaker 9 1:32:32 so it used to show up in writing things out, or it can do math in my head really well, but like writing some things out, like, just like, it can get a little A just like, get a little things like, oh and Speaker 3 1:32:55 spelling, oh, maybe you'd like to play a game with me. Then that nobody, Unknown Speaker 1:32:59 nobody ever wants to play with me. Speaker 8 1:33:05 I really want to get a couple of I like, go to a Speaker 3 1:33:14 and get a couple games of Scrabble. And I want to play redneck Scrabble. You just, like, mash them all together, and Unknown Speaker 1:33:18 then none of the words can actually, you can't spell them right, okay. Oh, and Speaker 3 1:33:29 what I mean by redneck scrabble is, like, I don't know very many people like, back at home that can spell. And so nobody Unknown Speaker 1:33:34 played, nobody played Scrabble. Unknown Speaker 1:33:39 Like, there's these, like, leave Speaker 3 1:33:41 it. They're kind of elitist in the in the sense of, like, these elitist games and like, and I'm like, Oh, I don't want to like, make people feel bad, you know about their intelligence, or Speaker 8 1:33:51 their like, bad spoiling. I just want to like, yeah, so whatever, yes, just fucking work it out on the board, Unknown Speaker 1:34:08 y, E, R, you're, Unknown Speaker 1:34:17 you're, you're, Unknown Speaker 1:34:21 but I don't care how you spell it, you, do you, you, Speaker 9 1:34:24 do you, you're, y'all know what I mean? Y'all Unknown Speaker 1:34:30 mean me, Unknown Speaker 1:34:32 yeah, yeah. Mean, I don't Unknown Speaker 1:34:34 care how you do it, it Speaker 8 1:34:36 just, it just sounds like fun and a good laugh. I try Unknown Speaker 1:34:44 to set people up for success Unknown Speaker 1:34:52 and people up for failure. Unknown Speaker 1:34:56 Everyone involved, Speaker 9 1:34:58 yeah, well, like English, I like that. Like, you're like, what's Unknown Speaker 1:35:06 that? Here, and why does this word mean there, Speaker 8 1:35:08 there, there. What the fuck are we doing? Speaker 3 1:35:16 Oh, here. I've been noticing that I'm writing here, H, E, A, R, Unknown Speaker 1:35:20 a lot, and I'm like, no here, doing that. Speaker 9 1:35:33 So my question, yeah, I'm just, yeah, it's just, I love to have being connected with you, beautiful, I mean, like, I don't know, just trying Speaker 8 1:35:48 to your your question, sort of the walking Yeah. Unknown Speaker 1:35:56 I was like, really. I Unknown Speaker 1:36:00 was like, I don't Unknown Speaker 1:36:02 question in a text sounds dangerous. Unknown Speaker 1:36:06 Einstein was like, Unknown Speaker 1:36:08 this sucks. Speaker 8 1:36:11 Does it the question in the text question? It has no nuance. It has no Unknown Speaker 1:36:17 no, Speaker 3 1:36:18 it just sucks. I mean, yes, I could give you like, the logical and like, use the fucking emojis to Unknown Speaker 1:36:25 whatever. Unknown Speaker 1:36:29 I was like, No, I hate this. I Yeah, yeah. Unknown Speaker 1:36:33 I was looking at it later. I was like, Oh, I was kind of Unknown Speaker 1:36:44 old. I like it really straightforward. Unknown Speaker 1:36:49 I don't hate it. Just, just so you know, I don't hate it. I do like it, Unknown Speaker 1:36:54 yeah, yeah, Unknown Speaker 1:36:57 just answer it. I Unknown Speaker 1:37:13 climate I've spent Unknown Speaker 1:37:22 since I was Unknown Speaker 1:37:25 18 So Unknown Speaker 1:37:29 seeking Unknown Speaker 1:37:34 foundational relationship, Speaker 8 1:37:43 learned a lot and obviously, Unknown Speaker 1:37:49 the last couple of relations left Unknown Speaker 1:37:51 me a little Unknown Speaker 1:38:01 little in Unknown Speaker 1:38:04 a for I'm Unknown Speaker 1:38:08 focused and trying to Unknown Speaker 1:38:14 settle ground my world Speaker 8 1:38:21 about sort of aligning else's needs in the sense of like Unknown Speaker 1:38:29 because I I'm generally the kind of person who Speaker 8 1:38:31 wants to collaborate and align create this, And I can also give and over share. So Speaker 3 1:38:49 if I hadn't dated JD, I would have probably had $60,000 in Unknown Speaker 1:38:53 my bank account. I don't have that credit. Speaker 3 1:39:00 There's a lot of things that I'm like, I'm in a lot of places which I know that you already heard Unknown Speaker 1:39:09 in, like, the way that I speak is like, I'm in a lot of places really not Unknown Speaker 1:39:12 prepared to be a really good partner. It Unknown Speaker 1:39:17 doesn't mean that I'm not going to get there. I just need Unknown Speaker 1:39:20 to find my safety first. Do I Speaker 8 1:39:24 want to continue to build a relationship with you a long distance? Yes, do I want to align my life with you currently? No, don't I don't know where Unknown Speaker 1:39:37 I'm going. I can't even tell you where. Speaker 3 1:39:41 I can't even give you because there's so many places, and there's a lot of things that will have to settle and there's a lot of fucking paperwork that I have to do to get into Speaker 8 1:39:52 a place of like, where I'm going to land, I'm going to do for work, Unknown Speaker 1:39:57 my health and all Speaker 8 1:39:59 of that. Oh, it's like, I would like to be more stable and non stable develop a relationship Unknown Speaker 1:40:26 that's in that Unknown Speaker 1:40:28 also just wanting to say, like I recognize the connection between us, Unknown Speaker 1:40:34 dynamic and the at all. Unknown Speaker 1:40:41 I agree with you that it's incredibly rare, but Unknown Speaker 1:40:44 I don't think that I would make a good partner for Unknown Speaker 1:40:48 you right now, because I'm Speaker 3 1:40:53 just trying to figure I'm just trying to be a good partner for me right now, and I'm that's all over the board, like my sleep, my eating habits right now. I'm not Unknown Speaker 1:41:03 sure what the fuck is going on. But like, Unknown Speaker 1:41:08 Fuck I also don't. I can imagine that doesn't feel very good. I Unknown Speaker 1:41:23 That's it. Unknown Speaker 1:41:32 Generous recognize, I tried to Unknown Speaker 1:41:40 explain it by saying the same word. Unknown Speaker 1:41:46 I saying, Hey, let me sort of hey, this is something I like, Speaker 8 1:41:54 or whatever me for emotional balance or support or care. Saying, Hey, look, it's like, I really Unknown Speaker 1:42:10 like to play some I I'm I'm in right now, pretty lot Speaker 9 1:42:14 of disappointment. They're totally not any words you say, but the like, I'm feeling a lot of disappointment from my previous relationship. And maybe didn't Unknown Speaker 1:42:25 say this. Maybe you don't feel like you Unknown Speaker 1:42:28 trust yourself in this moment to for your to Speaker 9 1:42:35 own safety, but also just like for what you're providing for another person. So there's that ethical thing that you're looking at yourself in your own situations. It's Speaker 8 1:42:48 gonna be a drag on your life and and it's not fair to me. Worst summary so far, Speaker 3 1:43:04 like you got it, there's disappointment, but that's not the driving factor here. Unknown Speaker 1:43:07 The driving factor is that I like you, Speaker 8 1:43:12 and I know what happens. It's one of the things that I've spent a lot of time thinking about and studying when people are in vulnerable places. When they start to date, I'm not at my best, then it creates this interesting attachment system. Speaker 3 1:43:39 I don't want to do that with you. I don't want to do that with anybody, but I really don't want to do that with you. I do that with you, because I respect you. And if I the next relationship I'm in in this like longevity piece is going to Unknown Speaker 1:43:53 be one where I Unknown Speaker 1:43:57 feel solid in myself, Speaker 8 1:44:00 trying to know someone or have a savior of some kind. Unknown Speaker 1:44:07 I want, want to feel like, Unknown Speaker 1:44:11 know that I bring a lot, know that you bring a lot. Unknown Speaker 1:44:17 I'm not bringing my best, Speaker 8 1:44:21 but I think I need okay, but I'm not bringing like, grounded. Unknown Speaker 1:44:30 I'm bringing a lot of new energy, Unknown Speaker 1:44:33 but I'm also bringing a lot of Unknown Speaker 1:44:38 chaos, Speaker 8 1:44:41 like, like, trying to figure out how I'm doing that, like, it's, I'm like, I'm like, Speaker 3 1:44:50 Oh, my God, I could just so, just awesome, and also potentially just crazy, Unknown Speaker 1:44:54 like that, balls crazy. Unknown Speaker 1:44:58 Where are you taking? Speaker 3 1:45:00 Oh, I'm in Berlin. Why are you in Berlin? Oh, because I'm checking out this Speaker 8 1:45:06 potential work house or today, over to Switzerland to do this thing. And Unknown Speaker 1:45:18 also there's like, I'm, Speaker 8 1:45:22 here's another. It's like, I really want to, I want to stop doing sex work, but I can't stop that yet. So the next relationship I want to be in is Unknown Speaker 1:45:33 a place where I'm not doing that anymore Speaker 9 1:45:41 because it's complicated. And you want to do that because you're in that place and not because there's a relationship. Unknown Speaker 1:45:51 I mean, that's why $1,000 Speaker 3 1:45:56 this person was wicked, insecure, insecure. But again, it complicates things in Speaker 8 1:46:01 such a manner that like been the most accepting relationships I've ever had. It still shifts the dynamic. Can't Unknown Speaker 1:46:13 even tell you what way it will it'll just shift the dynamic because Speaker 8 1:46:15 it's like a connection with someone else. I shadow in it. Unknown Speaker 1:46:23 Potentially, there's a Unknown Speaker 1:46:24 lot of shadows Unknown Speaker 1:46:29 partner. What your partner can be like? Well, Unknown Speaker 1:46:34 justify this because Unknown Speaker 1:46:36 they're doing that. That's Unknown Speaker 1:46:41 a no. I mean, I, I Speaker 8 1:46:49 and two people were doing sex work. And so they Speaker 9 1:46:55 did one leaving and then going back to it, and then one was just doing it. And then they said it was like out of my relationship with Ina, and then she was when I was dating. Was like, Oh, well, I was thinking of gun because just remember the Temple of blood. She's like, I was thinking about, like, if I did more full service stuff. I was like, what? And just like, it's really crushing. Like, we didn't just have a really beautiful day and like, guns and like special things, and it's just like, Oh, I was thinking. I was crushed. Speaker 8 1:47:31 I I was not place where I did, and I was just like, Speaker 9 1:47:35 need your brother with you. And she's like, begged me to say it was like, it was just, it's just all just didn't work out. Well, fairly those were, one was a couple months, and one was like, maybe nine months. Another one was just like, left and like, I really don't want to do this, and then ended up going back into it, Unknown Speaker 1:48:03 sort of like, wrapped her head around it like Speaker 8 1:48:06 I've spent a lot of time in this work. It doesn't live like lives for a lot of people, Speaker 3 1:48:16 deconstructing social norm behavior and relational norm behavior that I've done so I have extracted Unknown Speaker 1:48:24 my internal whore phobia society. Unknown Speaker 1:48:30 And so it's a place, Speaker 3 1:48:36 I mean, and there's also the other thing is, like, I only have so much energy work, and so the thing that I want to do is study. The thing that I want to do Speaker 8 1:48:45 is find this, like new path I'm on. Speaker 3 1:48:51 It's opening I'm I'm finding that it's opening some doors that I'm like, Unknown Speaker 1:48:56 Yeah, this is probably the path that I'm going into around Unknown Speaker 1:49:00 forensic psychology or some Speaker 8 1:49:01 sort of criminology fucking fun. Unknown Speaker 1:49:08 None of it has stabilized enough Unknown Speaker 1:49:10 for me to actually be able to work. Speaker 9 1:49:15 And so once, I mean, it's a, it's a interesting query for me, because I'm like, Okay, I'm really because I was around you, and I was like, first or second, I was like, I could, and I just felt like I could have a relationship with Trish, like, could be potentially my wife, or something like that. I was like, oh, okay, that's interesting. Because that doesn't, that's not a thought very often for me. I was like, Oh, that's interesting. And then I know these things value my egg, okay, what's interesting? I'm not even, wasn't really even trying to rectify the whole thing. I was just following the connection we were having and the person that you were being with me. So what's the person I am? Right? Yeah, so, so that was, Unknown Speaker 1:50:17 there's a curiosity in in that I was Unknown Speaker 1:50:19 like, okay, Speaker 9 1:50:22 and desire to make the museum. So there's, like, this different player. You know, I didn't action for any particular answer. When I am answered, It was like, it's just really, like, if, if it was, you can have anything with me, like, what is, what is the thing? And as I was curious Unknown Speaker 1:50:54 about that, it's like, if you Unknown Speaker 1:50:57 know what, what is, what is the deeper thought or Unknown Speaker 1:51:02 desire that you have? I Unknown Speaker 1:51:08 I mean, if all was like magical Unknown Speaker 1:51:16 and everything is just in Speaker 8 1:51:17 my ideal, or at least like moving, Speaker 3 1:51:26 I would feel more stable in my health and finances and Unknown Speaker 1:51:31 where I'm Living next. Unknown Speaker 1:51:38 Would love to Speaker 8 1:51:42 explore a monogamous connection, Unknown Speaker 1:51:53 and I'm a hot fucking mess. Speaker 3 1:51:56 I wouldn't say it's like I'm a hot mess. I'm just there's a lot of change right now Unknown Speaker 1:52:01 in my world that I have to settle before I Unknown Speaker 1:52:07 before I feel like I want to drag someone else Unknown Speaker 1:52:11 into this or unwillingly. Speaker 8 1:52:17 Because, as much as I could tell you and give you Unknown Speaker 1:52:25 your honest assessment, Unknown Speaker 1:52:29 able to know what Speaker 8 1:52:33 what information will be or how to share that information you make, to give You information, to make a conscious, consensual, informed choice. Unknown Speaker 1:52:46 There's two more this point, Unknown Speaker 1:52:52 let's say, six months Speaker 8 1:52:58 done all the little travels that I'm doing, and we've stayed in contact, and I've figured out that I'm working for, whatever it is that I'm working for, or I have a place I'm going to teach English, and I know that I'm going to be there for some time and settled, and that I've gathered what my health kind of looks like, and then I have some like, financial stability coming in at Unknown Speaker 1:53:32 and you're like, Yeah, I choose to. You're Unknown Speaker 1:53:34 like, Yeah, this is manageable, Unknown Speaker 1:53:37 reasonable. I'm Speaker 8 1:53:42 I probably won't be coming back to California. Clear, Unknown Speaker 1:53:56 unless there came with an enormous Unknown Speaker 1:53:57 dowry, ginormous Speaker 9 1:54:05 a ginormous dowry, everything's everything's possible Unknown Speaker 1:54:11 with, yeah, enormous dowry. Unknown Speaker 1:54:16 I just, I just joke with these kids like Unknown Speaker 1:54:20 I really should pay. Speaker 3 1:54:22 I shouldn't really ask them, because I know that I'm joking, but they have no idea what I said that to a girl. I was like, she's like, Oh, he's, he's kind of a jerk to Unknown Speaker 1:54:31 me, but like, Dick is really nice. And I was Speaker 3 1:54:36 like, and if he's a dick that is, that isn't even bare minimum, you're just, just use him for a stick fuck. And then I said, at this point, someone would have to fucking pay me an enormous Speaker 8 1:54:46 dowry to just pull me out of my piece. She Unknown Speaker 1:54:49 goes, Huh? And I was like, Oh, no. Probably Unknown Speaker 1:54:53 watch out what I say to these kids, Speaker 3 1:54:58 or the thing that I have said oh is like, Oh no, no. We don't pepper spray anybody anymore. We bear spray them because that's 30 feet. I don't want to get less than 10 feet of someone. Feet of someone. And someone Unknown Speaker 1:55:08 said it, that's like, oh, I should not tell Unknown Speaker 1:55:13 these kids these things, Unknown Speaker 1:55:18 like, illegal, right? Well, Unknown Speaker 1:55:20 I mean, if someone's like, Speaker 3 1:55:24 if I attacked and they're like, physically Unknown Speaker 1:55:28 intimidating me. I'm this is Unknown Speaker 1:55:32 definitely just kidding. So, yeah, there's, Speaker 8 1:55:42 there's just things don't love about the dating pool, or is that they don't really care about others. And Speaker 3 1:55:57 often, like, there's a lot of different strategies, but Speaker 8 1:56:01 like, like the the desire not to be alone, or to like curing kind of like loneliness and people will do All sorts of wild things, like, Unknown Speaker 1:56:17 I Unknown Speaker 1:56:26 want a long term partner Unknown Speaker 1:56:29 to explore my world and their world Unknown Speaker 1:56:34 with someone Speaker 8 1:56:39 with great community skills who's doing whatever for themselves and for everyone around Speaker 8 1:56:52 them. I don't want to be a placeholder. I don't want anyone to be a placeholder. I want to be want to be someone's safe place. I don't want to save them from their work. I Unknown Speaker 1:57:07 want to be elite. I don't want to use someone as a leaning post. Is that you feel that? Feel Speaker 8 1:57:22 that that's the place that you're at or, yeah, I'm, I mean, I wouldn't lean. No when, Speaker 3 1:57:30 when the security piece, it's not like internal insecurity, but like the way that my wife's set up right now. It's not stable. Speaker 8 1:57:37 Instability piece creates like an advanced structure. But a power dynamic. I'm just unwilling to Unknown Speaker 1:57:58 because I like you, because I like me, Speaker 8 1:58:02 because if I were to build a relationship with you, because, like, yeah, Unknown Speaker 1:58:10 interesting thing. A lot of these Speaker 9 1:58:17 different things and and I can go into my own, yeah, I can go into my own story of whatever you know I'm finishing a bankruptcy, and then I'm going to go through a divorce after that. And those okay. So those are like, those are not small things. Speaker 9 1:58:41 I feel like those are circumstances around my life. Those music, things that are happening around, around, round or adjacent to my life or within, Unknown Speaker 1:58:57 within, Speaker 9 1:59:02 however, I've gone through these experiences before, Unknown Speaker 1:59:09 like the financial, downturn, financial, Speaker 9 1:59:13 you know, upturn, downturn, like, beginning of of relationship, marriage. Like, I've gone through these experiences before, Unknown Speaker 1:59:23 and so while there are Unknown Speaker 1:59:32 things in people's lives that often like, Unknown Speaker 1:59:40 those things often really define Speaker 9 1:59:45 people, I really feel like those are are like the core of the person that I am is feels Unknown Speaker 1:59:53 very stable. Unknown Speaker 1:59:56 Itself feels very Unknown Speaker 2:00:00 and then the experience of Unknown Speaker 2:00:03 meeting different people being in Speaker 9 2:00:08 I can see seeing myself idealize certain people, or have connections and kind of like, okay, so the assessment piece, Okay, here's Unknown Speaker 2:00:20 doing this, doing this other, Unknown Speaker 2:00:26 being self aware, also discovering, you know, Unknown Speaker 2:00:31 like the piece about Unknown Speaker 2:00:33 something or being, Speaker 9 2:00:36 and a fantasy about what it is or what it isn't. And I feel Unknown Speaker 2:00:43 that with you, I feel Unknown Speaker 2:00:46 like I'm idealizing Unknown Speaker 2:00:48 Trish. I feel like there's Speaker 9 2:00:53 a I hear what you're saying. I hear the different pieces around your life, but there's also Unknown Speaker 2:00:59 actual experience with you, alright? Unknown Speaker 2:01:08 I feel, I see that you care, Speaker 9 2:01:16 sharing, that you have, that there's a mutuality, there's a reciprocal nature of things, how you're navigating world, and they're, like, Unknown Speaker 2:01:26 really special, and Unknown Speaker 2:01:29 the pool of humanity that I'm Speaker 8 2:01:33 in, and I think I recognize that and like, Okay, well, that's that is, for me, a connection that's worth continuing. Unknown Speaker 2:01:42 And I um, Speaker 9 2:01:48 and just seeing what it it could be. And I understand there's, like, a lot of different things around, like instability and like, it totally different. Totally get what you're saying. Um, Unknown Speaker 2:02:12 so the Unknown Speaker 2:02:16 the the experience, Unknown Speaker 2:02:24 the experience of able to Speaker 9 2:02:37 not edit myself and I'm around you, or feel like, oh, I have to Speaker 8 2:02:45 pull back this piece of myself, because it's just, can be really Speaker 9 2:02:54 disorienting for this person. Like, I just know, I just know that it's going to be they're not going to be able to Unknown Speaker 2:03:03 hold that come up, because gosh, Speaker 9 2:03:09 that was, that is special Unknown Speaker 2:03:13 experience, like, that's like, Speaker 8 2:03:17 so that is, I Unknown Speaker 2:03:30 that's part of like me saying, Okay, Unknown Speaker 2:03:34 how do you're Speaker 8 2:03:42 gonna have To say that part again, dropped out a smidge Unknown Speaker 2:03:46 okay from how do yeah, oh yeah, it Unknown Speaker 2:03:50 was just a big ass. Unknown Speaker 2:03:54 Oh, okay, let me get Speaker 8 2:04:02 it. I agree. Oh no, I oh no, Unknown Speaker 2:04:09 and I agree. I feel that Unknown Speaker 2:04:13 it's rare. Unknown Speaker 2:04:16 I'm not saying that. Speaker 8 2:04:23 Logical choice, no, no. There's like, two two pieces here, right? It's like, Ooh, I remember when I was like, This is Unknown Speaker 2:04:29 fucking annoying. Speaker 3 2:04:31 It's because I'm like, Oh, I'm off on this, like, fucking journey, like, right now. And Unknown Speaker 2:04:36 here's this person who I'm like, oh. Speaker 3 2:04:43 And she's like, come around, like, just a little while ago, before I made all these like, wild choices to, like, just uproot my whole world. Like, this is really fucking annoying. Speaker 8 2:04:59 It's been years. Honestly, I've Speaker 9 2:05:04 there's been a number of different points in time where I just wanted to connect with you and you're Unknown Speaker 2:05:11 like, and and Speaker 8 2:05:17 stuck in me to just like, okay, Speaker 9 2:05:22 yeah. And it just happened, really, I do need a car. I do let me look at this car. And then there was, you know, so it was like auspices of somebody. It was like the Speaker 8 2:05:39 I hear you I will take ownership of my Speaker 9 2:05:44 own. I yeah, I don't know what I'm I'm sure you had, I'm sure you had reasons. I'm sure there was like stuff going on, Unknown Speaker 2:06:04 and I feel, I'm sure, after it was there's a lot, there was Unknown Speaker 2:06:07 a lot of reasons, most Unknown Speaker 2:06:09 of them not to do with you. Unknown Speaker 2:06:12 I noticed, and noticed there was times Unknown Speaker 2:06:22 when I review Speaker 9 2:06:25 my life, and I go, Okay, I'm dating like a couple of people at the same time. I'm letting them know, yeah, we're dating. I'm kind of making an assessment of who I would like to be with long term. I just noticed, like I uh, Speaker 8 2:06:47 people with some great communication skills really cared, like, I just wasn't attractive, Speaker 9 2:06:59 needed or just drawn to somebody I could save, or I could do this with, or like it just, I just like this person, I need it. And then looking back, I'm like, just what a shitty, absolute fucking shit show of a fucking choice. I we Speaker 8 2:07:25 can get talk about a lot of that scientifically. Speaker 9 2:07:32 I just, yeah, I just, I'm like, wow, that is, that is that is amazing. That is, you know, and I look at kind of the trajectory of my life and relationship, and I'm like, that was, Unknown Speaker 2:07:43 you know, that was really, really, Unknown Speaker 2:07:48 I really jacked myself up with that, that particular Speaker 9 2:08:06 choice, yeah, got a formal tonight. I want to paint my tongues. Do you Unknown Speaker 2:08:15 think this puppy Speaker 3 2:08:17 has her desires? You know, we just talked about that in class a little bit, and it is like my particular study where Speaker 8 2:08:25 we don't have free will in our relationships, and like the hormonal, Speaker 3 2:08:31 genetic and the attachment stuff, and there's like, so much around that. Unknown Speaker 2:08:40 And I think, like, in some ways, you Unknown Speaker 2:08:47 I it took me Unknown Speaker 2:08:49 a long time to sort of Unknown Speaker 2:08:51 like unravel Unknown Speaker 2:08:56 these of the relationships and stuff Speaker 8 2:08:58 that I was in when I met you, Nina and Unknown Speaker 2:09:07 not that I remember. I didn't have like, Unknown Speaker 2:09:10 I don't have a lot of memory Unknown Speaker 2:09:13 around all of it, Speaker 8 2:09:16 other than like, I think that Ina and ina was a little like, Unknown Speaker 2:09:21 can imagine, and you really like me, Unknown Speaker 2:09:25 and I was like, This is so complicated. Speaker 8 2:09:27 And I was just like, trying to unravel Unknown Speaker 2:09:33 that whole experience and then through the like, Unknown Speaker 2:09:35 polyamorous experiences, and, Speaker 3 2:09:39 yeah, I just So again, it wasn't really anything. So when you're like asking, like, you're saying, like, I left an impression, or whatever. I'm like, Well, I don't really have a memory of you, because I was there Unknown Speaker 2:09:51 was a lot in my world at that moment. I had moved by my step Unknown Speaker 2:10:02 boyfriend's father, my ex boyfriend's father Speaker 3 2:10:06 was still nightmare, having nightmares about the first rape I experienced, Unknown Speaker 2:10:10 and just trying to figure out where I belonged, Speaker 3 2:10:15 and like, tons of weed, and trying to figure it out Unknown Speaker 2:10:18 on My own, and like, not really Unknown Speaker 2:10:22 just Speaker 8 2:10:25 alone in California, working it out, and then I think that is Unknown Speaker 2:10:34 where maybe you reached out. I just didn't Speaker 8 2:10:35 quite know where put you my world. Unknown Speaker 2:10:41 I was like, why? What? What does this person want with Unknown Speaker 2:10:54 me. Person want from me. What does this person want with Speaker 3 2:10:57 like, what is happening here? And, you know? Unknown Speaker 2:11:00 And I think that that's just, you know, Speaker 8 2:11:04 I'd like to believe people are good, but I don't anymore, and so I just, I don't actually think, like people are bad sometimes, don't know it is. And I, you know, I do have this, like, one rule in relationship, I think saved me from a lot of heartbreak, and it's one of my like polyamory rules is I have the triple win. This is my beliefs. So triple win would be the good for me. Is this relationship good for me? Is this relationship good for Unknown Speaker 2:11:44 you? That it has to be good for I Unknown Speaker 2:11:47 just sort of stepped out of a lot of relationships Speaker 3 2:11:51 if it wasn't gonna or whatever, because I was like, this is just so much fucking drama, and it just Speaker 8 2:11:56 seems like a lot of pain. So I'd self select out a lot. I think maybe that was like, I I was that part when I was with Los GA and that was just a hot, steaming, Unknown Speaker 2:12:11 abusive, shitty, fucking mess. I don't know. I didn't Unknown Speaker 2:12:20 want to bring anyone into that, because that was just embarrassing. I Unknown Speaker 2:12:34 don't know this is my own shit, though. Yeah, Speaker 8 2:12:42 thing and we can keep talking if you want to, like develop more of our adult friendship and flirtation. Speaker 8 2:13:01 I would like to see where this goes. I can't, can't offer you monogamy or Unknown Speaker 2:13:12 not to say that I don't, Unknown Speaker 2:13:19 I mean, yeah, I mean you're also, you're like, gonna Speaker 8 2:13:24 meeting all sorts of people, and you're out and about in the world, and there's all sorts of fun experiences to I'm Unknown Speaker 2:13:38 just trying to figure out my Unknown Speaker 2:13:39 citizenship, okay, yo, can't Unknown Speaker 2:13:45 even tell you where to even think about getting your citizenship, but I mean, right here, Unknown Speaker 2:13:52 here are my six different plans. It just Unknown Speaker 2:13:59 there's like, no, it's kind of crazy. Unknown Speaker 2:14:03 Like, I would like, and that would be like, Oh, hey, you feel about Unknown Speaker 2:14:09 these things. Oh, well, that doesn't Speaker 3 2:14:10 work out. Or maybe I decide to go back to school randomly, because I wake up one morning on the right side Speaker 8 2:14:16 of the bed, and you know what I mean, I'm like, Oh no, I don't know, do you want to but I love it here. Unknown Speaker 2:14:25 Love the conversation. Love Speaker 8 2:14:27 how they set up of learning. I love how slow the information is fucking just love it here. I love everything about the classes here right now, Unknown Speaker 2:14:41 inspired Unknown Speaker 2:14:44 to do my homework, but I'm really inspired by the content, Unknown Speaker 2:14:55 like feeling myself come back and my Unknown Speaker 2:15:01 feel so crabby I Unknown Speaker 2:15:07 you know, like your sweet loving as well, it Unknown Speaker 2:15:13 was very nourishing. You Unknown Speaker 2:15:23 too, very kind and thoughtful. Unknown Speaker 2:15:34 So what is possible? I Unknown Speaker 2:15:43 You don't have to give an answer. You can think about Unknown Speaker 2:16:02 it knowing to Unknown Speaker 2:16:05 make a choice. Come Unknown Speaker 2:16:17 here, come here, come up here, come up here. Good girl. Oh my gosh, Unknown Speaker 2:16:20 good girl. We're going in here every now i Speaker 8 2:16:32 There's net nice and warm in here. Oh my gosh. I Unknown Speaker 2:16:47 Are you going to get in Speaker 8 2:16:49 the hot tub? I'm going to throw the dog, and then I'm going to turn Speaker 9 2:16:55 on the turn on the at the toe thing. So poke Speaker 8 2:17:03 the foot right now, because it got cauterized and stuff. This is like slowly healing. Have Unknown Speaker 2:17:24 a lot of life is Unknown Speaker 2:17:28 you want, really, Speaker 8 2:17:31 ultimately, driving driver to like it's Speaker 9 2:17:43 in the relationship is belonging, and relationship is the it's the inconvenience that Unknown Speaker 2:17:49 you're looking for right. Unknown Speaker 2:17:55 Label it like Speaker 9 2:18:03 that, but doing a series of all sorts of really inconvenient things. Do you want to deal with the death of a partner's parents? Do you want to deal with the Speaker 9 2:18:20 challenges and disappointments of life that I'm trying to do this, and don't accomplish that or accomplish this. And, you know, just Speaker 9 2:18:34 disenchanted with it. You know, it's like it's just going through life. Unknown Speaker 2:18:41 The longevity of it is the willingness to Unknown Speaker 2:18:45 just keep doing it. Unknown Speaker 2:18:48 It's just we agree that. Unknown Speaker 2:19:03 Yeah, I believe you. I believe you are in a Unknown Speaker 2:19:07 big Jen, and I believe you that you you Speaker 8 2:19:11 like you're in a place to be a partner, not the partner that I want to be. I Unknown Speaker 2:19:29 easy, Unknown Speaker 2:19:38 my willingness to negotiate, Unknown Speaker 2:19:42 my willingness to I Unknown Speaker 2:19:45 don't really like the words. Speaker 8 2:19:48 I think it's, it always implies that someone loses. So Unknown Speaker 2:19:52 I like negotiate. I like to negotiate. Speaker 3 2:19:58 It's sounds like there's just like, there's some upfront conversations about Unknown Speaker 2:20:03 it, rather than compromise, which seems I past Unknown Speaker 2:20:09 tense. Think that Unknown Speaker 2:20:16 desire for my life is to Unknown Speaker 2:20:21 to a grounded space. Does that Unknown Speaker 2:20:33 looks like Unknown Speaker 2:20:38 we're going back to school? Speaker 3 2:20:40 That looks like getting my Speaker 8 2:20:44 visa of some kind somewhere. Unknown Speaker 2:20:55 And there's like six different approaches Unknown Speaker 2:20:56 here that I'm going to work on. All of them, I Speaker 8 2:21:03 It looks like that. And bringing my cat to wherever it is that I am school, and those are like in the works and so again, nothing like that. I have nothing. I have I've got, like, my general schedule, rules, like things that I get Unknown Speaker 2:21:28 that cover until the beginning Speaker 3 2:21:31 of the year. I suspect that as the days move here, I'm making friends, I'm making connections, Unknown Speaker 2:21:37 that things will open up for me Unknown Speaker 2:21:42 that is going to land me those things that I want, Unknown Speaker 2:21:51 and then I would have enough Speaker 8 2:21:53 space In my life to move with her, not just you, uh, Unknown Speaker 2:22:06 that they're going to just come with me on my path. Don't get me Speaker 3 2:22:12 wrong. Would that be lovely that just someone else to like, follow me around the world, to like, you're so fun, like, let's see what we get into now, you know, I mean, would that be fun? But I've never met anybody who really wants that, because people have hope skills and dreams, right? And like needs of their own. It's not like, I have, like, no. So it's, it's those things like, because I've never just given myself the opportunity to Speaker 8 2:22:40 solid foundation for myself, like that. That's where I'm at. It's like, Unknown Speaker 2:22:45 and so I don't think it's gonna take me long. Speaker 7 2:22:48 Like, it's gonna take me very long. I already have doors opening. Unknown Speaker 2:23:00 Cybersecurity thing is very interesting. So, lot of money in cybersecurity, Speaker 8 2:23:07 for sure, yeah, and it's, there's just, like, a lot of little super excited about. And the professor and I have daughter, I can't wait to meet their girlfriend next week. And, like, it's just really cool. Unknown Speaker 2:23:26 There's like, places, like that. I would Speaker 8 2:23:27 like to be able to have a place to be like, Simon, Unknown Speaker 2:23:33 this really sweet spot in the south of Spain, and Unknown Speaker 2:23:35 I'm teaching English. Do you want to come? Unknown Speaker 2:23:41 Like, I can't even do that here. I'm like, Unknown Speaker 2:23:44 You're someone's only allowed three nights here, Unknown Speaker 2:23:49 and it's 1250 Speaker 3 2:23:51 a night or something. Do you know? Do you see what I'm saying? It's like, it's my life isn't really set up in a way Speaker 8 2:23:57 that's like, partner. I mean, I want to be a good partner. You deserve it, and so do I? If Unknown Speaker 2:24:15 I wanted to, I want to be able to invest my life into someone, Unknown Speaker 2:24:24 a future. Speaker 8 2:24:26 Well, I mean, often what I think about, Unknown Speaker 2:24:34 a lot of people are looking for, like, Unknown Speaker 2:24:38 say something as Speaker 9 2:24:44 some of these Ukrainian divorces are like, oh, I need provider, and I need this and that it's like, okay, so I'm going to come into your life, yeah, I'm just going to provide, and I'm just going to create stability for you, and I'm going to get some significance these kids, Right? Like, obviously, not an offer that Unknown Speaker 2:25:05 at all. Speaker 8 2:25:09 They're just like they want to Unknown Speaker 2:25:15 plug into so their life looks easier. Unknown Speaker 2:25:21 And for them, Speaker 8 2:25:25 I want to build a life with someone Unknown Speaker 2:25:30 I can't right Unknown Speaker 2:25:34 now, I'm just trying to fucking create anything out Speaker 3 2:25:38 of my fucking life. You see, I like, I don't, I can't even give you anything other than like, you know, emotional intelligence in some ways, but there's a lot of not come that's not going to become there's, like, a lot of, yeah, so I mean, again, I've dated Unknown Speaker 2:25:55 around. I know I've had promises, Speaker 3 2:26:00 you know, Trish, quick circle, you do that and I can take care of you, and then Speaker 8 2:26:04 I'm begging for my rent to be paid. Oh, well, you'd have to stay here Speaker 7 2:26:11 and move in with me. I don't know that. Well, didn't tell me that, or have said, No, do Unknown Speaker 2:26:20 you see weird manipulations that people do like, Unknown Speaker 2:26:23 oh, please come take care of my kids with me. Want to Unknown Speaker 2:26:31 get into a rib Unknown Speaker 2:26:33 where we create it together? Yeah, I Unknown Speaker 2:26:39 mean, I come Speaker 9 2:26:46 and with ideas at all offer in that way at all, like, not like, approaching you like that in that way. So this fits your life. Or I'm going to do this, I'm going to do that like, doesn't like at all the way Unknown Speaker 2:27:04 relationship is just I want Unknown Speaker 2:27:18 to spend Unknown Speaker 2:27:21 time walk through the challenges coming. Unknown Speaker 2:27:33 Want all of those things Speaker 9 2:27:42 you're saying, you're saying, you're saying a lot of very reasonable things Unknown Speaker 2:27:48 of your life. Unknown Speaker 2:27:54 Just try to be nice, you know. Like, you know, you know idea Speaker 3 2:28:00 that we're supposed to put our best foot forward and like, like, like, this fucking trap just makes me angry. Like, oh, I have everything together, and I'm like, in Cambridge Speaker 8 2:28:09 and all of this stuff. Like, that's not fair to you. I give a shit about you all, I would just be like, Whoa, bro, here's here's the real deal. Well, Unknown Speaker 2:28:26 I'm in Yeah, I mean, Unknown Speaker 2:28:29 I, I don't want to do you.

And Speaker 8 2:28:43 then, holy, hot damn. Like she didn't tell me Speaker 3 2:28:49 just how, like it would be like if someone, if I was dating a woman and she had just been raped, like two weeks before, I Unknown Speaker 2:28:57 would have fucking wanted to know that, Unknown Speaker 2:29:00 you know what I'm saying, Unknown Speaker 2:29:05 to know that, like, Speaker 8 2:29:09 what I'm getting myself into at least a little bit. Yeah, Unknown Speaker 2:29:15 I think the things that for me are, like, the most difficult in Speaker 8 2:29:25 relationships is, you know, would Speaker 9 2:29:30 somebody get violent when I'm down, like, they get, like, physically violent with me? Would they where they resort name calling and instigating?
